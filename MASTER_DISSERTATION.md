## 📄 ABSTRACT

This research investigates how Ubuntu philosophy can bridge persistent gaps between multi-agent AI capabilities and real-world IT departmental operations. Despite significant advances in AI agent technology, organizational adoption remains limited due to fundamental disconnects—AI systems optimize individual performance while organizations require collective welfare, operate transactionally while organizations function relationally, and implement rigid hierarchies while organizational authority flows contextually. These technical-cultural mismatches prevent AI integration despite apparent technical readiness.

The study employs Design Science Research methodology to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophical principles—interconnectedness, collective responsibility, and communal decision-making—can address these organizational gaps. UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Departmental Collective Intelligence) serves as a research instrument deployed within Sun International GrandWest's IT department, operationalizing Ubuntu principles across strategic, tactical, and operational organizational levels through six AI agents mirroring actual departmental roles.

Using Reflexive Thematic Analysis of stakeholder interviews supplemented by interaction observation and system metrics, the research examines how IT staff across organizational levels experience and assess Ubuntu-driven AI agents in addressing collaboration gaps within authentic work contexts. The investigation generates empirical evidence regarding Ubuntu's bridging effectiveness and identifies transferable design principles for implementing culturally-aligned AI systems in organizational settings.

This research contributes the first empirical validation of Ubuntu philosophy as bridging mechanism for AI-organizational alignment, demonstrating that African relational ethics offers systematic responses to AI adoption challenges beyond purely technical optimization. The findings advance human-AI collaboration theory while providing practical guidance for organizations seeking to implement AI systems that respect cultural values and organizational realities.
