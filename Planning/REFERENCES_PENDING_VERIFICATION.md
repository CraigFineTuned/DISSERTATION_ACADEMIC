## Item 1: Ubuntu Ethics Recency Resolution — COMPLETE
- Resolution: Exclude Ramose pre-2020 for recency compliance. Use Metz (2022) as primary anchor and add at least one 2023–2025 peer-reviewed synthesis (e.g., The Ubuntu Way: Ensuring Ethical AI Integration in Health Research).
- Harvard entries status: Metz (2022) — already verified. Add the selected 2023–2025 synthesis to Harvard_References.md during final assembly.
- In-text citation policy: Prefer Metz (2022) for general Ubuntu ethics framing; cite Ramose (1999) when referencing the original relational ontology formulation.
- No placeholders remain in planning files.
- Finding: No Ramose (2023) publication located. Foundational work is Ramose, M.B. (1999) African Philosophy Through Ubuntu. Harare: Mond Books.
- Constraint: Recency (>=2020) preferred. 1999 can be included as a seminal exception if needed.

### Option A (Conservative): Use seminal source with exception note
- Ramose, M.B. (1999) African Philosophy Through Ubuntu. Harare: Mond Books. [Seminal; exception to recency]

### Option B (Preferred): Use 2020–2025 secondary sources that explicate Ramose’s Ubuntu account
- Candidate 1: Ubuntu | Diogenes (Cambridge Core). Year: 2020s. Type: Journal article. Action: Verify bibliographic details and Ramose discussion.
- Candidate 2: The Ubuntu Way: Ensuring Ethical AI Integration in Health Research (NIH/PMC). Year: ~2023–2024. Type: Review/Conceptual. Action: Verify scope and whether it engages Ramose’s ontological account.
- Candidate 3: Ubuntu philosophy, values, and principles: An opportunity to do social work differently (SAGE, 2025). Type: Perspective/Review. Action: Verify citations of Ramose and extract formulations usable for dissertation claims.
- Candidate 4: Integrating Ubuntu: embedding African philosophy into disaster risk reduction and management (NIH/PMC). Year: ~2022–2024. Type: Application/Review. Action: Verify philosophical grounding and Ramose references.
- Candidate 5: Ubuntu Philosophy as an African Ontology (MU-TAJOP). Year: 2020s. Type: Journal article. Action: Verify peer-review status and bibliographic details.
- Candidate 6: The African philosophy of Ubuntu and family businesses (Emerald). Year: 2020s. Type: Perspective article. Action: Verify how it cites Ramose and whether ontology/ethics content aligns.

Decision path:
1) Prefer 2020–2025 peer-reviewed journal articles that accurately summarize Ramose’s Ubuntu ontology/ethics.
2) If none are adequate, cite Ramose (1999) as foundational (exception) and pair with a recent secondary that contextualizes its ongoing relevance (metacitation strategy).

Planned action (Session 48):
- Verify Candidate 1–6 bibliographic data and full-text availability.
- Select 1–2 strongest sources to replace/augment Ramose (1999) for recency.
- Update Harvard_References.md and in-text citations accordingly.
