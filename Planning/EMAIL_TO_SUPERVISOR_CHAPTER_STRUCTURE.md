**To:** Jemini Matiya (jemini.matiya@richfield.ac.za)
**Subject:** Urgent: Dissertation Chapter Structure Clarification Needed
**Priority:** High

Dear Jemini,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm in the final stages of assembling my dissertation and need urgent clarification on the expected chapter structure based on the November 3rd dissertation support session.

### The Issue

In the support session transcript, you outlined the expected dissertation structure as having **6 chapters**:

1. Introduction
2. Literature Review  
3. Problem Statement (OR combined with Introduction)
4. Methodology
5. Results
6. Conclusion

However, my current dissertation has **7 chapters**, following conventional academic structure:

1. Introduction ✅
2. Literature Review ✅
3. Methodology ✅
4. System Design ⚠️
5. Results ✅
6. **Discussion** ⚠️ *(not mentioned in your guidance)*
7. Conclusion ✅

### My Question

**Does Richfield expect:**
- **Option A:** 6 chapters total with Discussion content merged into the final Conclusion chapter?
- **Option B:** 7 chapters with separate Discussion chapter is acceptable?

### Context

- All chapter content is complete and polished (92% overall completion)
- My "System Design" chapter documents the UGENTIC system as the research artifact (Design Science Research)
- My Discussion chapter interprets findings through Ubuntu ethics lens
- I can easily restructure if needed - just need confirmation before final assembly

### Current Status & Timeline

- **Dissertation completion:** 92% (68,000+ words across all chapters)
- **References:** 97 sources, all 2020-2025 ✅
- **Target submission date:** December 5, 2025
- **External proofreading planned:** November 15-22, 2025
- **Days remaining:** 26 days

### Why This Is Urgent

I'm ready to begin final assembly this weekend but cannot proceed without knowing the correct chapter structure, as it affects:
- Chapter numbering throughout the document
- Table of contents structure  
- Internal cross-references
- Page count calculations (target 80-120 pages)

### My Plan Based on Your Response

**If 6 chapters expected:**
- Merge Discussion + Conclusion into single "Chapter 6: Conclusion"
- Restructure System Design as part of Results or Methodology
- Renumber all chapters accordingly
- **Estimated time:** 2-3 hours

**If 7 chapters acceptable:**
- Keep current structure
- Verify with you that external examiners accept this format
- Proceed with assembly as-is
- **Estimated time:** Immediate proceed

### Request

Could you please confirm the expected structure by **Monday, November 11th**? This will allow me to complete final assembly next week and stay on track for the December 5th deadline.

If a brief meeting would be helpful to clarify this and any other structural questions, I'm available at your convenience this week.

Thank you for your guidance and support throughout this process.
