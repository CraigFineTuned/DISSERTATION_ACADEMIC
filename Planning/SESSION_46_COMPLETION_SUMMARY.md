# SESSION 46 – Retroactive Completion and Continuation Plan

Date: November 06, 2025
Session: 46 (Retro-documented)
Token Budget: 190,000
Tokens Used (cumulative): ~108,000 (57%) at end of Increment 2
Status: Recovery complete in this repository. Safe to continue.

Single Source of Truth:
C:\Users\craig\Desktop\MainProjects\Ugentic_Dissertation\DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC\Planning\SESSION_ENTRY.md

---

## Protocol Confirmation
- SESSION_ENTRY.md read and treated as nucleus (absolute path integrity maintained)
- CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md updated DURING session (retroactive in this repo)
- Incremental workflow enforced (BEFORE/DURING/AFTER)
- Cutoff guard: conclude before 85% token usage

---

## Increment Log

### Increment 1 – Theme-to-Section Mapping (Complete)
- Action: Create a comprehensive theme mapping quick reference for Chapter 5
- Output (created in this repo for continuity):
  - DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC/Data/Interviews/CHAPTER_5_THEME_MAPPING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- Content:
  - Four validated themes mapped to Chapter 5 sections with placeholders for quotes and participant IDs
  - Writing checklist, RQ mapping, evidence strength placeholders
- Tokens this increment: ~8K (cumulative ~54%)

### Increment 2 – Reference Integrity Check (Complete)
- Action: Verify absolute paths for nucleus-linked files; confirm presence of critical planning and analysis docs
- Output (created in this repo for continuity):
  - DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC/Planning/REFERENCE_INTEGRITY_CHECK_SESSION_46.md
- Result: 31 files checked; 29 present; all critical files exist; issues queued for follow-up if any
- Tokens this increment: ~4K (cumulative ~57%)

### Increment 3 – Add 3 Final Citations (Started)
- Targets:
  - Ncube (2024) – AI & Law in Africa context (edited volume/article – confirm exact)
  - Metz (2022) – Relational moral theory / Ubuntu ethics (confirm venue)
  - Masoga (2023) – If not locatable, use authoritative 2023 Ubuntu alternative
- Status: Sources located; ready to add to Harvard_References.md with verification markers

---

## Decisions and Next Steps
- Proceed to Increment 4 (Draft Section 5.1 – Introduction to Results) after citations are added OR proceed now and backfill citations immediately after 5.1 draft (both acceptable).
- Maintain DURING updates after each increment in CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md and commit.
- Create SESSION_47_CONTINUATION at session start if needed.

---

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Workspace divergence between local Windows path and repo
  - Mitigation: Treat SESSION_ENTRY.md as the nucleus; mirror outputs into this repo with absolute-path references.
- Risk: Citation accuracy for the three additions
  - Mitigation: Add with “VERIFIED SESSION 46” markers once details confirmed; keep placeholder if uncertain.
