- Line 250: "(Gwagwa et al., 2022)" - WAS "Mkhize (2022)" per Session 34

- Section 1.4: "(Odero et al., 2024)" - STILL EXISTS (was supposed to be replaced?)

**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Some corrections made, unclear if all complete

## ⏳ UNVERIFIED ACTIONS

Need to check Chapters 3 and 4 for claimed corrections:

**Chapter 3 (2 claimed corrections):**
1. Braun et al. → Braun & Clarke (2024)
2. Haj-Bolouri → vom Brocke et al. (2020)

**Chapter 4 (6 claimed corrections):**
1. Dafoe → Moore (2025)
2. Masoga → Mutswiri et al. (2025)
3. Ncube → Kolawole & Ncube (2024)
4. Metz - add full reference
5. Holstein - REMOVE VAGUE CLAIM
6. Sætra - REMOVE VAGUE CLAIM

**Status:** ⏳ NEEDS VERIFICATION

## 🎯 LOGICAL TRACE FINDINGS

**What definitely happened:**
1. ✅ Kolawole & Ncube (2024) added to references
2. ✅ Metz, T. (2022) added to references
3. ✅ At least one Chapter 1 correction made (Mkhize → Gwagwa)
4. ✅ SESSION_ENTRY.md header updated

**What's uncertain:**
1. ⏳ Were all 11 chapter corrections executed?
2. ⏳ Why does Odero still exist if it was supposed to be replaced?
3. ⏳ Were Chapters 3 and 4 corrected?
4. ⏳ Why wasn't CHECKPOINT updated if Session 39 was complete?

**What definitely didn't happen:**
1. ❌ SESSION_39_COMPLETION file NOT created
2. ❌ CHECKPOINT NOT updated to Session 39
3. ❌ Decision documentation files NOT created

**Step 4:** Update CHECKPOINT to reflect actual state
**Step 5:** Create proper Session 39 completion doc if work was done
