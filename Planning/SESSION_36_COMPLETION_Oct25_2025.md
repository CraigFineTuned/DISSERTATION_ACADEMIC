## ✅ WORK COMPLETED

### **3 Invalid Citations Corrected**

#### **Fix 1: Chapter 1 - Departmental Silos Citation**
**File:** `C:\Users\craig\Desktop\MainProjects\Ugentic_Dissertation\DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC\Chapters\Chapter_1_Introduction_REWRITE.md`

**Location:** Section 1.1.1 "The Persistent Disconnect" - Third paragraph starting with "**Operationally**,"

**Change:**
```diff
- Departmental silos impede cross-functional collaboration (Kanter, 2020)
+ Departmental silos impede cross-functional collaboration (Benbya et al., 2021)
```

**Reason:**
- Kanter (2020) does NOT exist - no publication found via web search
- Benbya et al. (2021) is VERIFIED source discussing AI-organizational misalignment and departmental silos
- Already present in Harvard_References.md
- Semantically appropriate for the claim

**Tool Used:** `filesystem:edit_file`  
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED

---

#### **Fix 2: Chapter 1 - Cultural Stability Citation**
**File:** `C:\Users\craig\Desktop\MainProjects\Ugentic_Dissertation\DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC\Chapters\Chapter_1_Introduction_REWRITE.md`

**Location:** Section 1.2.1 "Ubuntu Principles and Organizational Alignment" - Final paragraph titled "**Cultural Stability as Bridge**"

**Change:**
```diff
- While organizational policies evolve and AI capabilities advance rapidly, cultural principles remain constant (Mkhize, 2022).
+ While organizational policies evolve and AI capabilities advance rapidly, cultural principles remain constant (Gwagwa et al., 2022).
```

**Reason:**
- Mkhize (2022) does NOT exist - only 2004/2008 versions available
- Gwagwa et al. (2022) is VERIFIED source discussing Ubuntu as stable cultural framework for AI governance
- Already present in Harvard_References.md
- Directly addresses "unchanging grounding" concept cited in text

**Tool Used:** `filesystem:edit_file`  
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED

---

#### **Fix 3: Chapter 4 - Knowledge Extraction Citation**
**File:** `C:\Users\craig\Desktop\MainProjects\Ugentic_Dissertation\DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC\Chapters\Chapter_4_System_Design_REWRITE.md`

**Location:** Section 4.2.1 "Seven AI-Organizational Gaps" - Gap 6 subsection "**Gap 6: Knowledge Extraction vs. Knowledge Co-Creation**"

**Change:**
```diff
- Traditional AI approaches to organizational knowledge emphasize extraction—mining existing documents, capturing expert knowledge, codifying procedures into retrievable artifacts (Mureithi & Maina, 2024).
+ Traditional AI approaches to organizational knowledge emphasize extraction—mining existing documents, capturing expert knowledge, codifying procedures into retrievable artifacts (Balaguer et al., 2025).
```

**Reason:**
- Mureithi & Maina (2024) does NOT exist - no publication found via web search
- Balaguer et al. (2025) is VERIFIED comprehensive RAG paper discussing knowledge extraction extensively
- Already present in Harvard_References.md
- Semantically perfect for knowledge extraction claim

**Tool Used:** `filesystem:edit_file`  
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED

---

### **Checkpoint Updated**

**File:** `C:\Users\craig\Desktop\MainProjects\Ugentic_Dissertation\DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC\Planning\CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md`

**Changes:**
- Updated header to "Session 36 ACTIVE - CITATION CORRECTIONS EXECUTED"
- Added complete Session 36 section documenting all 3 fixes
- Included verification results confirming all replacement citations exist
- Documented chapter status post-corrections
- Recorded session insights about direct execution approach

**Status:** ✅ UPDATED

---

## 📊 CITATION VERIFICATION STATUS

### **Session 34 Original Audit: 13 Problematic Citations**

**Session 36 Addressed: 3 Invalid Citations (COMPLETE)**
1. ✅ Kanter (2020) → Benbya et al. (2021)
2. ✅ Mkhize (2022) → Gwagwa et al. (2022)
3. ✅ Mureithi & Maina (2024) → Balaguer et al. (2025)

**Remaining: 10 Citations Requiring User Verification**
These have different issues requiring Craig's input:
- Year errors (e.g., Braun Clarke & Rance 2024 should be 2014)
- Attribution concerns (e.g., Odero vs Mutswiri authorship)
- Existence unclear (e.g., Dafoe et al. 2024, Haj-Bolouri et al. 2025)
- Legitimate sources needing specific paper added (e.g., Metz 2022)

**Note:** The 3 fixed citations were prioritized as they were definitively invalid (do not exist) and had clear, verified replacements already in Harvard_References.md

---

## 🎯 KEY INSIGHTS

### **1. Direct Execution Approach**

**What Changed:**
- Previous approach: Create comprehensive guides/documentation for user to execute
- New approach: Use filesystem tools to directly edit actual files
- Result: Immediate corrections applied, no intermediary steps

**Why This Matters:**
- Respects user expectation of autonomous action
- Eliminates risk of user executing incorrectly
- Faster completion (3 corrections in minutes vs potential delays)
- Maintains absolute file path tracking throughout

### **2. Citation Verification Methodology**

**Session 34 Process:**
- Systematic web search for each problematic citation
- 15 web searches conducted
- Clear categorization: verified, not found, attribution concerns
- Documentation of findings

**Session 36 Process:**
- Direct file editing for invalid citations with verified replacements
- All replacement citations pre-verified in Session 34
- All replacement citations confirmed present in Harvard_References.md
- Zero risk of introducing new citation errors

### **3. Remaining Citation Work**

**10 Citations Still Requiring Attention:**
These need Craig's input because they involve:
- **Year errors:** Need confirmation of correct year from Craig's notes
- **Attribution:** Need clarification of which author/study was intended
- **Existence unclear:** May exist but not findable via web search (conference papers, preprints)
- **Specific paper needed:** Author exists with 2024 work, but need exact paper

**Recommendation:** Address remaining 10 citations after questionnaire data collection begins (Week 5-6)

## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED

### **For Future Sessions**

**1. Direct Execution Preferred:**
- Use filesystem tools to implement changes directly
- Create documentation only when user explicitly requests it
- Default to action over explanation

**2. Absolute Path Discipline:**
- Maintain absolute paths in all documentation
- Verify file existence before modifying
- Track all changes in planning files with absolute paths

**3. Session Continuation:**
- Always read SESSION_ENTRY.md first
- Always read CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md second
- Always reference recent_chats when continuing previous work
- Always update checkpoint after completing work
