QUESTION 1: Ubuntu in Your Own Words
How would you describe Ubuntu philosophy in your own words?
(If you’re not familiar: Ubuntu means “I am because we are” - we become who we are through our relationships with others.)
Your answer: Be kind, be caring. Love another such as you love yourself. Don’t discriminate. Understand that every individual is different with their own flaws, it is such flaws which makes each individual unique. We are all humans, regardless of colour, culture, lineage or relativity…we should stand together and achieve great things

________________________________________
Do you see Ubuntu values (helping each other, team support, collective responsibility) in how the IT team works together?
Your answer: Yes. Only when theres no Departmental political factions. Those can have an effect on the quality of teamwork…these consists of individuals inheriting bad habits like being egotistic, arrogant, incompetent, controlling, narcissistic and rebellious.

What frustrates you most about collaboration in IT - like getting information you need or coordinating with other teams?
Your answer: If there is a lack of experience and terminology between the individuals, especially via telecommunication method.

________________________________________
Can you give a specific example of when collaboration was difficult?
Your answer: When a bank was down in the smoking casino due to a network switch issue and I did not understand even basic terminology and testing explained over telephone. Due to the severity of the issue it was frustrating as I was alone on shift.

What would make your daily work easier?
Your answer: Having automation perform the basic daily tasks in order for myself to focus more on work productivity

QUESTION 3: When Things Go Wrong
When there’s an incident or problem, how does the team handle it?
Your answer: Gather data on the nature of the incident or problem, review said data and review similar past issues for probable resolution. Escalate to the relevant teams only if all local troubleshooting steps have been exhausted

________________________________________
Is it more “whose fault is this?” or “how do we fix it together?”
Your answer: Fix first, ask questions later

QUESTION 4: Research Artifact – UGENTIC-AI Concept
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
As part of my Honours research, I designed and built a prototype multi-agent AI system mirroring your IT structure, called UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence). This is a research artifact - not a commercial product - created to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can help bridge gaps between AI capabilities and real IT department operations.
The prototype has six AI agents mirroring the IT department structure:
- IT Manager Agent 
- Service Desk Manager Agent 
- IT Support Agent 
- Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents 
Each agent is designed to embody Ubuntu principles: 
- Help each other across teams 
- Share solutions, not blame 
- Ask for input, not just command 
- Explain clearly what they're doing 
This research investigates WHETHER this Ubuntu-driven approach can address collaboration gaps in IT departments. Your perspective helps validate or challenge this design concept.
________________________________________
Based on your experience with IT collaboration challenges:
Does this Ubuntu-driven design approach sound like it could help, or does it sound impractical? 
Your answer: Yes, It would bridge the shortfall of human interaction

________________________________________
What would this design need to get right to actually be useful in your daily work?
Your answer: A simple/ non complicated UI

________________________________________
What concerns do you have about this approach?
Your answer: If it becomes reliable, it might evolve by using troubleshooting data to become self sustainable and resolve issues on its own, hence make human employees lazy or it would allow for more remote work. Worse case scenario, many employees will be retrenched, business will require less staff and would save a lot more money.

QUESTION 5: Trust & Usefulness
What would make you trust this system versus ignore it or not trust it?
Your answer: Sensitive Data could not be compiled correctly. So there is a possibility of audits results being at risk

________________________________________
How would you want to interact with it? (Chat? Dashboard? Something else?)
Your answer: I prefer chatbot, its quick and easy

________________________________________
Would it respect your expertise or talk down to you?
Your answer: Respect. We already have colleagues talking down on others, so we don’t need that

________________________________________
QUESTION 6: Final Thoughts
Is there anything about IT work, team collaboration, or AI that we haven’t talked about but you think I should know?
Your answer: AI is powerful, Everyone that plays a part in its development, is increasing the risks of a potential invasion.
