QUESTION 1: Ubuntu in Your Own Words
How would you describe Ubuntu philosophy in your own words?
(If you’re not familiar: Ubuntu means “I am because we are” - we become who we are through our relationships with others.)
Your answer:
I’ve heard the phrase “I am because we are,” and I respect that it comes from our soil. But in my experience, especially growing up in a place where you learn early that no one’s coming to save you, reliability starts with yourself. Ubuntu sounds nice in meetings, but when the slot floor is down at 3 a.m. and you’re the only one on shift, it’s your knowledge, your discipline, and your willingness to get your hands dirty that fixes the problem—not a team cheer. 
________________________________________
Do you see Ubuntu values (helping each other, team support, collective responsibility) in how the IT team works together?
Your answer:
Some do. Our 1st line team has that vibe—covering shifts, sharing fixes, celebrating together. And that’s fine for them. But I’ve seen “teamwork” used as an excuse for mediocrity: “Oh, someone else will handle it,” or “We’ll figure it out later.” In my view, clarity beats camaraderie. If everyone owns their piece cleanly, the system works. I don’t need a group hug to do my job—I need clear expectations and the space to execute.

QUESTION 2: Daily Frustrations
What frustrates you most about collaboration in IT - like getting information you need or coordinating with other teams?
Your answer:
The assumption that “collaboration” means constant group discussion. I’d rather get a well-documented ticket with clear symptoms than sit in a huddle where half the people haven’t read the background. Also, the expectation that I should drop everything to help someone who hasn’t even tried basic troubleshooting. If you can’t ping a gateway, don’t escalate—learn first. 
________________________________________
Can you give a specific example of when collaboration was difficult?
Your answer:
During the Call Pay rollout, I was asked to “collaborate” with interns who hadn’t been trained on the deployment process. They kept asking me to verify their work, but they hadn’t followed the checklist. I ended up redoing half of it myself—not because I wanted to, but because the deadline mattered more than their learning curve. That’s not teamwork; that’s cleanup. 
________________________________________
What would make your daily work easier?
Your answer:
Clear role boundaries, up-to-date documentation, and accountability for effort—not just outcomes. If you escalate, show your work. If you’re assigned a task, own it. I don’t mind helping—but I won’t carry someone who won’t carry themselves.
________________________________________
QUESTION 3: When Things Go Wrong
When there’s an incident or problem, how does the team handle it?
Your answer:
It depends. If it’s urgent, I focus on resolution, not consensus. I’ll loop in others only if their expertise is essential—not for moral support. 
________________________________________
Is it more “whose fault is this?” or “how do we fix it together?”
Your answer:
Honestly? “Fix it” first, “fault” later—but only if it’s needed for prevention. I’m not interested in blame games, but I also don’t believe in pretending everyone tried their best when they didn’t. In my world, competence is the baseline, not a bonus.

QUESTION 4: Research Artifact – UGENTIC-AI Concept
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
As part of my Honours research, I designed and built a prototype multi-agent AI system mirroring your IT structure, called UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence). This is a research artifact - not a commercial product - created to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can help bridge gaps between AI capabilities and real IT department operations.
The prototype has six AI agents mirroring the IT department structure:
- IT Manager Agent 
- Service Desk Manager Agent 
- IT Support Agent 
- Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents 
Each agent is designed to embody Ubuntu principles: 
- Help each other across teams 
- Share solutions, not blame 
- Ask for input, not just command 
- Explain clearly what they're doing 
This research investigates WHETHER this Ubuntu-driven approach can address collaboration gaps in IT departments. Your perspective helps validate or challenge this design concept.
________________________________________
Based on your experience with IT collaboration challenges:
Does this Ubuntu-driven design approach sound like it could help, or does it sound impractical? 
Your answer:
It depends on what “Ubuntu-driven” really means. If it means an AI that reduces noise, validates effort before escalation, and routes issues to the right person fast, then yes. But if it’s designed to force “collaboration” where none is needed—like auto-adding people to tickets just to “include the team”—it’ll slow us down. 
________________________________________
What would this design need to get right to actually be useful in your daily work?
Your answer:
Respect for individual competence and don’t assume I need help unless data shows I’m stuck.
________________________________________
What concerns do you have about this approach?
Your answer:
That it’ll be used to mask poor hiring or training. If leadership thinks AI will “fix collaboration” while ignoring skill gaps, it’s a waste. Also, if it logs every interaction as “team health data,” that feels like surveillance, not support. 
________________________________________
QUESTION 5: Trust & Usefulness
What would make you trust this system versus ignore it or not trust it?
Your answer:
If it saves me time, not adds process. If it surfaces real patterns—like “this intern keeps missing step 3”—so we can train, not just repeat. 
________________________________________
How would you want to interact with it? (Chat? Dashboard? Something else?)
Your answer:
A clean dashboard with ticket status, system health, and one-click access to logs. No chatbots asking how I feel. 
________________________________________
Would it respect your expertise or talk down to you?
Your answer:
As long as it doesn’t treat me like I need hand-holding, we’ll be fine. I’ve been doing this since before half the team was born. 
________________________________________
QUESTION 6: Final Thoughts
Is there anything about IT work, team collaboration, or AI that we haven’t talked about but you think I should know?
Your answer:
Ubuntu is a beautiful idea—but in high-stakes environments like ours, reliability isn’t collective; it’s personal. You can’t outsource accountability to a team. If UGENTIC supports individual excellence while reducing avoidable friction, it has value. But if it tries to turn IT into a circle of trust, it’ll fail. We’re not here to bond. We’re here to keep the lights on.
