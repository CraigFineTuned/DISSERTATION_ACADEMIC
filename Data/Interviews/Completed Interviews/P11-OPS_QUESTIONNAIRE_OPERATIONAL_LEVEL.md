QUESTION 1: Ubuntu in Your Own Words
How would you describe Ubuntu philosophy in your own words?
(If you’re not familiar: Ubuntu means “I am because we are” - we become who we are through our relationships with others.)
Your answer:
Ubuntu is about recognizing that we’re all connected. In IT, that means my success isn’t just about keeping my apps running—it’s about making sure the whole chain works, from the user clicking a button to the database saving the record. If the network’s down or the Service Desk doesn’t understand the error, my app might as well be broken. So yeah, “I am because we are”
________________________________________
Do you see Ubuntu values (helping each other, team support, collective responsibility) in how the IT team works together?
Your answer:
It depends on the team.

QUESTION 2: Daily Frustrations
What frustrates you most about collaboration in IT - like getting information you need or coordinating with other teams?
Your answer:
At night, when something breaks that’s beyond my pay grade, I escalate—and then… nothing. No acknowledgment, no ETA, just a ticket sitting in limbo. Meanwhile, the slot floor supervisor is calling every 10 minutes because every minute of downtime costs thousands. I’m stuck in the middle: not technical enough to fix it, not authoritative enough to demand action.
________________________________________
Can you give a specific example of when collaboration was difficult?
Your answer:
player tracking kiosks froze during a high-roller event. Guests couldn’t check points, and the marketing team was furious. I ran diagnostics—everything pointed to the API between the kiosk and the loyalty database. I escalated to App Support at 1:30 a.m.
No reply.
So I did. Network replied at 6 a.m.: “App layer is timing out. Not us.”
By 7 a.m., the day shift took over, and Hadley had to personally call both team leads to get them in a room. Turned out it was a certificate expiration in the API gateway—something neither team monitored.
For five hours, two critical systems were down, and the only thing moving was blame. That’s not IT failure. That’s human failure.
________________________________________
What would make your daily work easier?
Your answer:
Someone—or something—that bridges the gap. Not another ticketing system, but a coordinator who understands both sides. Who can say, “Hey Network, App Support needs your firewall logs from 1–3 a.m.” and actually get them. Who doesn’t care about team boundaries—only about fixing the problem.
________________________________________
QUESTION 3: When Things Go Wrong
When there’s an incident or problem, how does the team handle it?
Your answer:
In our team? We activate “swarm mode.” One person handles comms with the floor, one digs into systems, one documents everything, and one watches for knock-on effects. No titles, no hierarchy—just roles based on who’s available and capable. We don’t ask “Whose job is this?” We ask “Who can help?”
But cross-team? It’s like herding cats. Everyone waits for someone else to take charge. And if no one does, the problem just… sits there.
________________________________________
Is it more “whose fault is this?” or “how do we fix it together?”
Your answer:
With Service Desk: “Fix it together” — always.
With specialists: “Whose fault” starts before the customer is even back online. And it’s not about learning—it’s about covering yourself. I’ve seen post-mortems where the real issue was ignored because no one wanted to admit their monitoring was blind.

QUESTION 4: Research Artifact – UGENTIC-AI Concept
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
As part of my Honours research, I designed and built a prototype multi-agent AI system mirroring your IT structure, called UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence). This is a research artifact - not a commercial product - created to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can help bridge gaps between AI capabilities and real IT department operations.
The prototype has six AI agents mirroring the IT department structure:
- IT Manager Agent 
- Service Desk Manager Agent 
- IT Support Agent 
- Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents 
Each agent is designed to embody Ubuntu principles: 
- Help each other across teams 
- Share solutions, not blame 
- Ask for input, not just command 
- Explain clearly what they're doing 
This research investigates WHETHER this Ubuntu-driven approach can address collaboration gaps in IT departments. Your perspective helps validate or challenge this design concept.
________________________________________
Based on your experience with IT collaboration challenges:
Does this Ubuntu-driven design approach sound like it could help, or does it sound impractical? 
Your answer:
It sounds like the missing piece. An AI that doesn’t have an ego, doesn’t play politics, and just wants the problem solved? That could cut through the noise. If it sees a ticket and automatically pulls data from Xurrent, Sourcing, and the app logs, then says, “Here’s the most likely root cause—and here’s who to loop in,” that’s huge.
And if it does it without making me feel stupid for not knowing? Even better.
________________________________________
What would this design need to get right to actually be useful in your daily work?
Your answer:
First, it must understand casino urgency. A frozen printer in HR can wait. A downed cage terminal cannot. Second, it needs real integration—not just reading tickets, but accessing live monitoring feeds. Third, it must speak human, not tech. Instead of “API gateway TLS handshake failed,” say “The kiosk can’t talk to the loyalty system because of a security certificate—here’s the fix.”
________________________________________
What concerns do you have about this approach?
Your answer:
That it becomes a cost-cutting tool. My team isn’t just ticket-closers—we’re the eyes and ears on the floor. We know when a slot machine is acting weird before it logs an error. AI can’t replace that intuition. Also, if it’s not updated when systems change, it’ll give wrong advice—and then no one will trust it.
________________________________________
QUESTION 5: Trust & Usefulness
What would make you trust this system versus ignore it or not trust it?
Your answer:
Prove it’s on my side. If it helps me solve problems faster and shields me from unfair blame, I’ll trust it. But if it starts second-guessing me in front of management or suggests things that don’t work in the real world, I’ll ignore it like I ignore half the alerts in Sourcing.
________________________________________
How would you want to interact with it? (Chat? Dashboard? Something else?)
Your answer:
A chat interface for users as first line or someone to take our calls and assign provisionally.
________________________________________
Would it respect your expertise or talk down to you?
Your answer:
Don’t tell me to “reboot and try again” when I’ve already done that twice. But if you say, “This matches a known issue with the player tracking v2.1—want the workaround?”—that’s respect. It’s about assuming competence, not ignorance.
________________________________________
QUESTION 6: Final Thoughts
Is there anything about IT work, team collaboration, or AI that we haven’t talked about but you think I should know?
Your answer:
The emotional toll is real. At night, you’re alone with the weight of the whole casino’s tech on your shoulders. When a specialist dismisses you, it’s not just frustrating—it’s isolating. You start doubting yourself.
