QUESTION 1: Ubuntu Understanding
How would you describe Ubuntu philosophy in your own words?
(If you’re not familiar: Ubuntu means “I am because we are” - we become who we are through our relationships with others.)
Your answer:
• Celebrating team wins rather than individual heroes 
• When someone struggles, the team helps rather than blames 
• Leaders see themselves as servants to the team's success 
• Knowledge sharing is natural, not competitive________________________________________
As Service Desk Manager, do you see yourself as serving the team or directing them? How do you approach leadership?
Your answer:
I see myself as both serving and directing my team. I'm a hands-on leader who gets involved in the work alongside them. I direct and set expectations, but I make sure I give them all the tools and support they need to succeed. I create a relaxed working environment where people can be themselves and have a laugh, but they also know when pressure is on, we get the job done. I put trust in my team - I believe that when you trust people and support them, they rise to the challenge________________________________________
QUESTION 2: Coordination Challenges
What are your biggest challenges coordinating between your IT Support team and the specialist teams (Network, App Support)?
Your answer:
My biggest challenge is the egos and the disconnect that comes with the specialist teams. There's a culture where Network and App Support engineers feel the way to teach someone is to expose them - they'll email everyone and CC management to call out a mistake publicly. They think this teaches the tech to 'do the right thing next time.' I fundamentally disagree with this approach. A simple in-person conversation to guide the tech in the right direction would be far more effective and build better relationships. This blame culture creates fear and division instead of collaboration.________________________________________
Can you describe what happens when a ticket needs escalation? Where do things break down?
Your answer:
When a ticket gets escalated, the tech gets questioned first before the actual issue is addressed - 'What did you troubleshoot? Did you check this? Why didn't you do that?' However, this doesn't happen consistently. Certain techs get grilled while others don't, and I believe it's based on who the specialists perceive as less competent. This creates an unequal and demoralizing experience. Instead of focusing on solving the customer's problem, we're wasting time interrogating the tech. It reinforces the divide between teams and makes my techs hesitant to escalate even when they should, because they're afraid of being questioned and judged rather than supported________________________________________
QUESTION 3: Team Success & Responsibility
When your team successfully resolves a complex issue, how do you think about that success - is it one person’s win or the team’s?
Your answer:
It's the team's win. Because we work in a 24/7 environment, it's difficult to celebrate as a full team all together, but when something complex gets resolved by multiple techs, we make sure to celebrate them. Complex issues rarely get solved by one person alone - it takes collaboration, knowledge sharing, and people backing each other up across shifts. I recognize that success as collective, not individual.________________________________________
When something goes wrong, how does the team handle responsibility?
Your answer:
It's the team's win. Because we work in a 24/7 environment, it's difficult to celebrate as a full team all together, but when something complex gets resolved by multiple techs, we make sure to celebrate them. Complex issues rarely get solved by one person alone - it takes collaboration, knowledge sharing, and people backing each other up across shifts. I recognize that success as collective, not individual.________________________________________
QUESTION 4: Ubuntu-AI Concept
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
As part of my Honours research, I designed and built a prototype multi-agent AI system mirroring your IT structure, called UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence). This is a research artifact - not a commercial product - created to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can help bridge gaps between AI capabilities and real IT department operations.
The prototype has six AI agents mirroring the IT department structure:
- IT Manager Agent
- Service Desk Manager Agent (your role)
- IT Support Agent
- Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents

Each agent is designed to embody Ubuntu principles:
- Help each other across teams
- Share solutions, not blame
- Ask for input, not just command
- Explain clearly what they're doing

This research investigates WHETHER this Ubuntu-driven approach can address collaboration gaps in IT departments. Your perspective helps validate or challenge this design concept.
________________________________________
Based on your experience with coordination challenges:
Does this Ubuntu-driven design approach sound like it could help, or does it sound impractical?
Your answer:
I think this Ubuntu-driven design approach could help. The biggest issue we face is ego and blame culture from the specialist teams - they shame techs publicly instead of helping them. AI agents designed without that ego, that focus on sharing knowledge and supporting rather than judging, could create a better coordination environment. It could treat all techs consistently rather than questioning some more than others based on perceived competence. If the AI models collaborative behavior - helping across teams, explaining clearly, sharing solutions - it might even influence how the human specialists interact. At minimum, it removes the emotional barriers that currently block effective coordination.
________________________________________What would this design need to get right to actually be useful in your coordination work?
Your answer:
For this to actually be useful, it would need to deeply understand our casino environment. We're not a typical IT shop - we deal with gaming systems, regulatory compliance, 24/7 operations where downtime directly costs money, and security protocols that can't be compromised. The AI would need to know our specific systems - slot machines, player tracking, cage systems, surveillance infrastructure - and understand the compliance requirements we operate under. It would need to prioritize correctly (a slot floor outage is different than a back-office printer issue). It would also need to integrate with our ticketing system and have access to our documentation and procedures. Generic IT knowledge wouldn't cut it - it needs to understand casino operations, our workflows, and the critical nature of gaming availability________________________________________
What concerns do you have about?
Your answer:
My biggest concern is the replacement of staff. While I see the value in AI helping with coordination and knowledge sharing, I worry that management might view this as an opportunity to reduce headcount rather than as a tool to support the team. The point should be to help my techs work more effectively and reduce the friction with specialist teams - not to replace people. In a 24/7 casino environment, we need human judgment, especially when dealing with critical gaming systems and high-pressure situations. If this becomes a cost-cutting exercise rather than a genuine support tool, it will destroy morale and ultimately fail. The AI should augment what we do, not replace who we are.________________________________________
QUESTION 5: Authority & Trust
Would AI coordinating work undermine your authority or support it?
Your answer:
I think AI would support my job function as IT Service Desk Manager. My role involves strategic and operational management - overseeing incident resolution, analyzing trends for root cause analysis, developing SOPs, conducting audits and risk assessments, managing team performance and development, maintaining stakeholder relationships, and managing budgets and procurement. An AI coordination system could handle routine operational coordination and provide better data insights for trend analysis and reporting. This would free me to focus on the strategic aspects - talent development, process improvement, compliance oversight, stakeholder engagement, and budget management. It could also ensure consistent adherence to SOPs and provide 24/7 coordination support across shifts when I'm not available. My authority comes from leadership, strategic decision-making, and people management - not from being the daily coordination point. AI would enhance my ability to do the strategic work that matters.________________________________________
What would make you trust it? How would you want to interact with it?
Your answer:
What would make me trust it is transparency and proven accuracy over time. I'd need to see what decisions it's making and why, with the ability to override when necessary. Clear audit trails would be essential for compliance and accountability. For interaction, I'd want a dashboard that gives me visibility into coordination activity, ticket flow, and escalation patterns - feeding into the trend analysis and reporting I'm responsible for. Ideally, it would integrate with our Xurrent ITSM tool and our Sourcing monitoring system. Currently, these two don't integrate with each other, which creates blind spots. AI that could bridge that gap - correlating monitoring alerts from Sourcing with incidents in Xurrent - would be incredibly helpful. I'd want mobile access for after-hours monitoring, automated alerts for critical incidents, and reports that support my SLA tracking and root cause analysis work. If it can demonstrate it improves incident resolution times and provides reliable data for my strategic decision-making, trust would build naturally.________________________________________
QUESTION 6: Ubuntu Authenticity
Does this Ubuntu approach sound authentic to you, or does it sound performative?
Your answer:
Yes, this Ubuntu approach sounds authentic to me. What makes it genuine is that I can see these principles already working in my Service Desk team - they have each other's backs, they focus on solving problems rather than assigning blame, and they succeed together. The Ubuntu philosophy of 'I am because we are' isn't abstract - it's exactly how my team operates daily. The problem is that the specialist teams don't operate this way; they use ego and public shaming instead. If an AI system is designed from the ground up with these collaborative, supportive principles, it's not performative - it's codifying the values that actually work. It's authentic because it's addressing a real cultural gap we experience, not just adding trendy language to technology.________________________________________
Would your team recognize this as Ubuntu? Does the cultural framing matter?
Your answer:
I think my team would recognize this as Ubuntu and the cultural framing does matter. They understand the concept - even if they haven't always called it by that name, they'd recognize the values because it's how we already operate. Being in Cape Town, the Ubuntu philosophy has cultural relevance and resonance. It's not some foreign corporate concept imported from overseas; it's rooted in our context. I think naming it Ubuntu gives legitimacy and meaning to what we're trying to build - it's not just 'being nice' or 'teamwork,' it's a recognized philosophy about how people should relate to each other. My team would be open to it because they already live these values, and having a name for it reinforces that what we do isn't just my management style - it's part of a deeper cultural principle.________________________________________
QUESTION 7: Advice for Other Coordinators
If another Service Desk Manager was considering this approach, what would you tell them?
Your answer:
I'd tell them it could help, especially if they're dealing with ego-driven specialist teams and coordination friction. But be clear with management upfront - this is about supporting your team and improving coordination, not replacing staff. Make sure the AI understands your specific environment; generic solutions won't work. If your team already operates collaboratively, this reinforces what you're doing. If they don't, AI alone won't fix your culture. It's a tool, not a magic solution.________________________________________
What would make it succeed or fail? What needs to be in place?
Your answer:
It would succeed if management commits to using it as a support tool, not a cost-cutting measure. You need proper integration with your ITSM and monitoring systems, team training and buy-in, and customization to your specific environment. It fails if it's implemented as generic software without understanding your operations, if leadership uses it to justify reducing headcount, or if there's no transparency in how it works. The cultural piece matters too - if specialist teams actively resist or sabotage it, no technology will fix that. Success requires both technical implementation AND organizational commitment to the Ubuntu principles behind it.________________________________________
QUESTION 8: Final Thoughts
Is there anything about team coordination, Ubuntu leadership, or AI that we haven’t discussed but you think is important?
Your answer:
I think we've covered the main points. The key takeaway for me is that Ubuntu principles already work in my team - the challenge is extending that across the silos to specialist teams. If AI can bridge that gap without replacing people, it has real potential. But it has to be implemented thoughtfully, with respect for the human element that makes IT support work in a high-pressure casino environment.________________________________________
