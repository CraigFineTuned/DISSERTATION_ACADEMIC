2.	QUESTION 1: Ubuntu in Your Own Words
How would you describe Ubuntu philosophy in your own words?
Ubuntu… that word’s been around longer than most of the servers in this building. In my day, we didn’t call it Ubuntu—we just called it decency. It meant if your mate was stuck on a ticket at midnight, you took his call. If a new guy messed up a config, you showed him how to fix it—quietly, without shame. You didn’t build your reputation on someone else’s mistake.
Now they’ve got a fancy name for it, but the heart’s the same: we’re only as strong as the weakest among us—and it’s our job to lift them up, not step over them.
Do you see Ubuntu values (helping each other, team support, collective responsibility) in how the IT team works together?
In Hadley’s team? Ja, absolutely. She’s got the right spirit. I’ve watched her defend her techs against unfair blame, share credit when things go right, and stay late when the floor’s on fire. That’s leadership.
But the specialist teams? Eish. It’s gotten worse over the years. When I started in ’00, Network and Apps sat with us. We ate lunch together. Now? They’re in their own bubble, speaking their own language, acting like their systems are too sacred for the rest of us to understand. I started in the year 2000 at Boardwalk Casino in Port Elizabeth.
Ubuntu isn’t dead—but it’s compartmentalized. Strong in Service Desk. Weak everywhere else.

3.	QUESTION 2: Daily Frustrations
What frustrates you most about collaboration in IT - like getting information you need or coordinating with other teams?
The loss of shared ownership. Back in the day, if a system went down, everyone cared—because we all felt responsible for the casino’s success. Now? It’s “That’s not my system.” “That’s above your pay grade.” “Read the documentation.”
And the documentation? Half of it’s outdated or locked behind permissions only specialists have. So we’re expected to fix things blindfolded—and then blamed when we can’t.
Can you give a specific example of when collaboration was difficult?
Last year, during the big surveillance system upgrade, the new cameras kept dropping feed. Service Desk got flooded with tickets. I knew it wasn’t our workstations—it was the video management software.
I called the App Support lead—someone I’ve known since 2008. He said, “Lucian, I can’t talk. Just log a ticket.”
So I did. Three days later, no update. I called again. He said, “We’re busy with strategic work. Your tickets aren’t urgent.”
Not urgent? When security can’t see the high-limit tables?
Hadley had to escalate to the IT Manager to get it fixed. Turned out they’d changed an API endpoint and didn’t tell anyone.
That’s the problem: knowledge is power, and some people hoard it to feel important.
What would make your daily work easier?
A return to shared purpose. Or failing that—an AI that forces transparency. If UGENTIC could say, “App Support changed X at 2 p.m.—here’s the impact,” it would stop this nonsense.

4.	QUESTION 3: When Things Go Wrong
When there's an incident or problem, how does the team handle it?
In our team? Like a family. We’ve got each other’s backs. But cross-team? It’s like watching strangers argue in a lift—everyone avoids eye contact until it’s over.
Is it more "whose fault is this?" or "how do we fix it together?"
In the old days: “Fix it together.”
Now: “Whose fault”—and the faster you assign blame, the sooner you look clean.
I’ve seen post-mortems where the real issue was a lack of communication, but no one said it—because admitting that would mean admitting everyone failed. So they blamed a “misconfigured script” and moved on. Nothing changed.

5.	QUESTION 4: Research Artifact – UGENTIC System
Based on your experience with IT collaboration challenges:
Does this Ubuntu-driven design approach sound like it could help, or does it sound impractical?
After 25 years, I’m skeptical of shiny solutions. But… this one feels different. Because it’s not just about efficiency—it’s about values. If you can build an AI that models the way we used to work—respectful, transparent, collective—then maybe it can remind people what we’ve lost.
What would this design need to get right to actually be useful in your daily work?
•	Historical awareness: Know that this casino runs on legacy systems and new tech
•	Contextual urgency: Understand that a slot floor outage isn’t “just another ticket”
•	Enforce transparency: Auto-log changes and notify impacted teams
•	Respect experience: Don’t treat veterans like relics
What concerns do you have about this approach?
That it’ll be another tool that ignores human wisdom. I’ve seen too many “smart” systems fail because they didn’t account for the chaos of real operations. Also, if it’s used to justify getting rid of seasoned staff—people who know why certain systems are built the way they are—you’ll lose institutional memory no AI can replace.

6.	QUESTION 5: Trust & Usefulness
What would make you trust this system versus ignore it or not trust it?
If it learns from us, not just data. If it asks, “Lucian, why do we reboot this server every Friday?” and listens to the answer—that’s trust.
How would you want to interact with it? (Chat? Dashboard? Something else?)
A dashboard for overview, but voice or chat for real-time help. At my age, I don’t need flashy UI—I need clarity.
Would it respect your expertise or talk down to you?
I’ve forgotten more about this infrastructure than most of these specialists will ever know. Don’t tell me “best practice” unless you’ve walked these floors during a New Year’s Eve meltdown. Respect isn’t assumed—it’s earned. Your AI better earn it.

7.	QUESTION 6: Final Thoughts
Is there anything about IT work, team collaboration, or AI that we haven't talked about but you think I should know?
This year marks my 25th anniversary. I’ve seen three IT managers, five major system overhauls, and countless “revolutionary” tools come and go.
What lasts isn’t the tech—it’s how people treat each other.
If UGENTIC can bring back that spirit—the one where we were all on the same side, fighting for the casino, not our egos—then you’re onto something real.
But don’t call it “AI collaboration.” Call it “remembering who we are.”
Because Ubuntu isn’t new. It’s just what we used to be—before we forgot.
