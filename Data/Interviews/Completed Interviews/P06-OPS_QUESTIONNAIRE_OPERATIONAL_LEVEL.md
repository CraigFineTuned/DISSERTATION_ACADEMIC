QUESTION 1: Ubuntu in Your Own Words
How would you describe Ubuntu philosophy in your own words?
(If you’re not familiar: Ubuntu means “I am because we are” - we become who we are through our relationships with others.)
Your answer:
[So Ubuntu to me means community, drive and goals.
When we stick together it is not easy to break us nor bring us down because we are always thinking or fighting for each other and building the next generation making sure not to deviate from our culture, love and respect for each other. 
Drive: We know what is expected of us we each know and respect hierarchy or authority everyone knows their place/role and even though no one’s perfect nor knows everything we can each learn and accept advice even if it comes from someone from a younger/subordinate and not only want to give commands because you’re in a higher position also respect everyone we still still accept it because the goal is for the betterment of the community or which ever environment that brings you together as a team as in a team you stop being an individual but become a part of the team in order for the vision to be fulfilled and as much as you learn about others in a team you learn about yourself as well. The kind of strength and weakness you have and can learn from each other to grow together and become stronger.

Goals: The goals are what keeps us moving forward because we all want to succeed when we all work for the betterment of each other that brings joy when we see that even those that were or would otherwise be given up on shine that is what Ubuntu is about being each other’s strength when the other’s hope fails, we carry each other not for recognition but for the vision to keep going for us all to achieve or goals being happy when the next person wins being there when fear sets in. It doesn’t me just because I can’t I shouldn’t assist the next person that can, God gifts us with different gift and responsibilities so that we can work together in unity to achieve a common purpose.]
________________________________________
Do you see Ubuntu values (helping each other, team support, collective responsibility) in how the IT team works together?
Your answer:
[It does work but sometimes we tend to get tired of doing things a certain way because we forget  our calling and the fact that the team is about support and other times the issue is on the other side where just because one is willing to assist they would be exploited and that drains people and they most of the time end up being altogether disconnected and that puts a strain on the team as there’s a member who’s not happy and is no longer enjoying nor has peace in their role because of being overwhelmed by it all.

There is team support I believe in our team is very supportive we can do come together and stand with each other but with many things where there are people involved there would be those crazy instances of disengage because of exhaustion and stress but we come back together even though there’s a lot of work that needs to be done in members understanding their roles and respect their team mates  more would help with compromise on all parties. ]

QUESTION 2: Daily Frustrations
What frustrates you most about collaboration in IT - like getting information you need or coordinating with other teams?
Your answer:
[Sharing of information, communication people hog things and get frustrated when tasks long to co be completed yet these issues would be avoided if proper communication and information sharing was done. Knowing that we a team we come first, we don’t allow anyone nor anything to break the unity and trust that we have/should already have. We can work with other teams and extend or hand to them but we need to make sure we ourselves have enough before we can pour in other teams cups because other teams can frustrate you and get you in trouble. 
Collaboration within a team is as a challenge as long as you and your partner don’t understand or respect each other. When you get to know and understand each other better and communicate well you can achieve and excel in whatever task you were given and in Ubuntu you both shine and not say ‘I’ did it but ‘We’ did it together.  ]
________________________________________
Can you give a specific example of when collaboration was difficult?
Your answer:
[Space for answer]

What would make your daily work easier?
Your answer:

QUESTION 3: When Things Go Wrong
When there’s an incident or problem, how does the team handle it?
Your answer:
[Panic does set in at times because we’re working on a live environment, and rules change constantly but the team does rally together and push for the greater goal. Even when there are disagreements at the time it is understood that we need to get rid of the issue to get business back in order. I only wish we could just be honest with each other in the end of how we feel things could have been handled and not whisper behind each other’s back but make things better then we can all grow from our experiences and move on.]
________________________________________
Is it more “whose fault is this?” or “how do we fix it together?”
Your answer:
[It is how do we fix it together because business comes first, and we need to make sure that our team doesn’t come up last or be known as failures. We fight with each other, but we fight for each other when we need to. Our main goal is to get things running no matter what at the end Ubuntu is at the center of this department we just need more patience and understanding.]

QUESTION 4: Research Artifact – UGENTIC-AI Concept
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
As part of my Honours research, I designed and built a prototype multi-agent AI system mirroring your IT structure, called UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence). This is a research artifact - not a commercial product - created to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can help bridge gaps between AI capabilities and real IT department operations.
The prototype has six AI agents mirroring the IT department structure:
- IT Manager Agent 
- Service Desk Manager Agent 
- IT Support Agent 
- Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents 
Each agent is designed to embody Ubuntu principles: 
- Help each other across teams 
- Share solutions, not blame 
- Ask for input, not just command 
- Explain clearly what they're doing 
This research investigates WHETHER this Ubuntu-driven approach can address collaboration gaps in IT departments. Your perspective helps validate or challenge this design concept.
________________________________________
Based on your experience with IT collaboration challenges:
Does this Ubuntu-driven design approach sound like it could help, or does it sound impractical? 
Your answer:
[It is very much practical everyone can learn to give more and also learn from the next person as long as you understand what Ubuntu is all about. Ubuntu is about community and sharing and keeping each other up and moving forward no team mate gives up or is given up on, It’s all about strength in togetherness.]
________________________________________
What would this design need to get right to actually be useful in your daily work?
Your answer:
[Respect, being a team and cheering for each other, extending a helping hand and leave out. That helps those who had given up or were about to to get to the end and be proud of their achievements and want and not be afraid of a challenge when it comes because that makes them much more proud of themselves and their teammates and you gain so much respect and appreciation for each other which is something which is lacking and can help individuals and teams grow so much more.]
________________________________________
What concerns do you have about this approach?
Your answer:
[People may dismiss it because they worried about sentiments and forget about the great rewards which may come out from putting Ubuntu in our teams and that also pours out into our societies where we think about helping the next person that might be going through something by just reaching out you can change someone’s day their outlook in life as a whole.]

QUESTION 5: Trust & Usefulness
What would make you trust this system versus ignore it or not trust it?
Your answer:
[Ubuntu is an African philosophy, we can all grow from learning and living by the teachings of community we’ve lived by for millennia and has not  failed not even once. You reach great heights individually as a team/department and the business grows to levels never expected and you gain respect from other businesses because everyone speaks about the growth they attained in your company ]
________________________________________
How would you want to interact with it? (Chat? Dashboard? Something else?)
Your answer:
[All these forms of communication are extremely important to bring everyone aboard. You need to talk about it, dashboards as reminders and encouragement to start putting it into practice.]
________________________________________
Would it respect your expertise or talk down to you?
Your answer:
[Obviously it’s respect because everyone is considered no person is made to feel lonely and belittled there is mutual respect and a sense of belonging.]

QUESTION 6: Final Thoughts
Is there anything about IT work, team collaboration, or AI that we haven’t talked about but you think I should know?
Your answer:
[No not at all.]
