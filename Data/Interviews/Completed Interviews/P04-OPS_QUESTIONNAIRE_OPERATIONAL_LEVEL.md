QUESTION 1: Ubuntu in Your Own Words
How would you describe Ubuntu philosophy in your own words?
(If you’re not familiar: Ubuntu means “I am because we are” - we become who we are through our relationships with others.)
Your answer:
Ubuntu means that we grow and succeed through one another. It emphasizes respect, collective support, shared responsibility, and uplifting each other so the whole team can perform better. It’s the belief that we are stronger when we collaborate and value each person’s contribution.________________________________________
Do you see Ubuntu values (helping each other, team support, collective responsibility) in how the IT team works together?
Your answer:
Yes, especially when there are major incidents or critical operational tasks. We rely on each other across different IT functions such as networking, infrastructure, and application support. However, there are still gaps, sometimes communication delays or siloed work can prevent full collaboration. When the team does apply Ubuntu values, the work becomes more efficient and users are assisted faster.________________________________________
QUESTION 2: Daily Frustrations
What frustrates you most about collaboration in IT - like getting information you need or coordinating with other teams?
Your answer:
The biggest frustration is the delay in getting the right information or feedback when an issue requires multiple teams. Sometimes responsibilities are not clearly defined, which leads to misunderstandings and longer resolution times. Escalations can also take time, especially when relying on external vendors or central IT teams.________________________________________
Can you give a specific example of when collaboration was difficult?
Your answer:
During critical application outages, like when casino systems or ERP applications malfunction, it may take time to involve all stakeholders who need to diagnose the issue. Each team focuses on their component, but shared visibility is limited, which causes delays in restoring service.________________________________________
What would make your daily work easier?
Your answer:
Better real-time communication between teams, shared visibility into system health, standardized troubleshooting procedures, and faster access to required resources. A platform that improves transparency of incident ownership and progress would reduce back-and-forth and improve user experience.________________________________________
QUESTION 3: When Things Go Wrong
When there’s an incident or problem, how does the team handle it?
Your answer:
We follow incident management procedures, incidents are logged, prioritized, and stakeholders are updated. We do work together under pressure, especially in gaming where downtime has financial impact. However, communication and clarity on handovers can improve.________________________________________
Is it more “whose fault is this?” or “how do we fix it together?”
Your answer:
Mostly “how do we fix it together,” especially when downtime affects operations. But when the pressure is high, there can be moments where blame or ownership disputes arise before the solution is fully executed.________________________________________
QUESTION 4: Research Artifact – UGENTIC-AI Concept
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
As part of my Honours research, I designed and built a prototype multi-agent AI system mirroring your IT structure, called UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence). This is a research artifact - not a commercial product - created to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can help bridge gaps between AI capabilities and real IT department operations.
The prototype has six AI agents mirroring the IT department structure:
- IT Manager Agent 
- Service Desk Manager Agent 
- IT Support Agent 
- Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents 
Each agent is designed to embody Ubuntu principles: 
- Help each other across teams 
- Share solutions, not blame 
- Ask for input, not just command 
- Explain clearly what they're doing 
This research investigates WHETHER this Ubuntu-driven approach can address collaboration gaps in IT departments. Your perspective helps validate or challenge this design concept.
________________________________________
Based on your experience with IT collaboration challenges:
Does this Ubuntu-driven design approach sound like it could help, or does it sound impractical? 
Your answer:
It sounds useful because IT environments today require strong collaboration, fast decision-making, and knowledge sharing. An AI system that proactively supports communication between teams, explains solutions clearly, and reduces escalation delays could improve operational efficiency.________________________________________
What would this design need to get right to actually be useful in your daily work?
Your answer:
•	Real-time sharing of accurate system status and incident information
•	Respectful communication that does not override human expertise
•	Actionable recommendations, not generic responses
•	Integrating with ITSM tools so teams don’t switch between platforms
•	Transparent decision-making and clear reasoning by the AI________________________________________
What concerns do you have about this approach?
Your answer:
•	AI must not interfere with compliance or security processes.
•	It must not create extra work or excessive notifications.
•	Trust may be affected if the system makes incorrect assumptions.
•	Data protection and access control must be carefully managed.________________________________________
QUESTION 5: Trust & Usefulness
What would make you trust this system versus ignore it or not trust it?
Your answer:
Accuracy, reliability, and evidence-based recommendations. The system must show that it understands operational constraints and respects compliance rules and regulatory requirements in the casino industry.________________________________________
How would you want to interact with it? (Chat? Dashboard? Something else?)
Your answer:
A combination of a chat-based assistant and a dashboard that gives visibility on incidents, performance dashboards, and recommended actions.________________________________________
Would it respect your expertise or talk down to you?
Your answer:
It should recognize the knowledge and experience of technicians and engineers. It must collaborate with us, not replace, or undermine our judgment. Respect and mutual support align with Ubuntu principles.________________________________________
QUESTION 6: Final Thoughts
Is there anything about IT work, team collaboration, or AI that we haven’t talked about but you think I should know?
Your answer:
IT teams operate under high pressure, especially in regulated environments like casino operations where uptime is critical. Any AI or collaborative tool must value teamwork, clarity, and compliance. AI can be a strong enabler in reducing operational noise, speeding up troubleshooting, and strengthening cross-team alignment — as long as it enhances, rather than disrupts, human collaboration.________________________________________
