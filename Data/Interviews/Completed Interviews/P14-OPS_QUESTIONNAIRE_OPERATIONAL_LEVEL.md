QUESTION 1: Ubuntu in Your Own Words
How would you describe Ubuntu philosophy in your own words?
(If you’re not familiar: Ubuntu means “I am because we are” - we become who we are through our relationships with others.)
Your answer:
Ubuntu means we rise together—but only if we’re given the same ladder. Right now, some people have all the rungs, and some of us are told to climb barefoot. True Ubuntu would mean sharing knowledge freely, not guarding it like a secret handshake. 
________________________________________
Do you see Ubuntu values (helping each other, team support, collective responsibility) in how the IT team works together?
Your answer:
I’m met with, “You were shown this.” But showing once isn’t teaching. And if I ask twice, I’m “not paying attention.” That’s not Ubuntu—that’s gatekeeping.

QUESTION 2: Daily Frustrations
What frustrates you most about collaboration in IT - like getting information you need or coordinating with other teams?
Your answer:
The assumption that I should already know everything. 
________________________________________
Can you give a specific example of when collaboration was difficult?
Your answer:
During a rollout of specific links, I installed the link on three managers’ PCs but missed the fourth. No one told me all four were urgent. When the IT Manager asked why it wasn’t done, I felt set up to fail. If someone had said, “All four are priority—confirm each,” I would have. 
________________________________________
What would make your daily work easier?
Your answer:
Clear expectations and shared checklists.

QUESTION 3: When Things Go Wrong
When there’s an incident or problem, how does the team handle it?
Your answer:
My team supports me. Others? They document my error for the record. 
________________________________________
Is it more “whose fault is this?” or “how do we fix it together?”
Your answer:
“Whose fault” as some are easier targets for blame.

QUESTION 4: Research Artifact – UGENTIC-AI Concept
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
As part of my Honours research, I designed and built a prototype multi-agent AI system mirroring your IT structure, called UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence). This is a research artifact - not a commercial product - created to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can help bridge gaps between AI capabilities and real IT department operations.
The prototype has six AI agents mirroring the IT department structure:
- IT Manager Agent 
- Service Desk Manager Agent 
- IT Support Agent 
- Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents 
Each agent is designed to embody Ubuntu principles: 
- Help each other across teams 
- Share solutions, not blame 
- Ask for input, not just command 
- Explain clearly what they're doing 
This research investigates WHETHER this Ubuntu-driven approach can address collaboration gaps in IT departments. Your perspective helps validate or challenge this design concept.
________________________________________
Based on your experience with IT collaboration challenges:
Does this Ubuntu-driven design approach sound like it could help, or does it sound impractical? 
Your answer:
Only if it levels the playing field. If it gives me the same context specialists have, then yes.________________________________________
What would this design need to get right to actually be useful in your daily work?
Your answer:
Auto-generate task checklists with required confirmations and explain specialist jargon in plain terms.
________________________________________
What concerns do you have about this approach?
Your answer:
That it’ll be another tool that assumes I’m lazy, not lost.
________________________________________
QUESTION 5: Trust & Usefulness
What would make you trust this system versus ignore it or not trust it?
Your answer:
If it treats my questions as valid, not burdensome. 
________________________________________
How would you want to interact with it? (Chat? Dashboard? Something else?)
Your answer:
Chat—private, no logs visible to managers.________________________________________
Would it respect your expertise or talk down to you?
Your answer:
I’m not an expert—but I’m not dumb. Meet me where I am.________________________________________
QUESTION 6: Final Thoughts
Is there anything about IT work, team collaboration, or AI that we haven’t talked about but you think I should know?
Your answer:
Ubuntu can’t be one-sided. If seniors want us to “pull our weight,” they must first show us the path. UGENTIC could be that path—if it’s built with humility, not hierarchy.
