QUESTION 1: Ubuntu Understanding
How would you describe Ubuntu philosophy in your own words?
(If you’re not familiar with Ubuntu: It’s an African philosophy meaning “I am because we are” - the idea that we become who we are through our relationships with others. Individual success comes through community support.)
Your answer:
Ubuntu, to me, is the understanding that no one succeeds alone. It’s the belief that our individual worth and capability are deeply tied to how we treat, support, and uplift those around us. It’s not a management tactic or a corporate slogan - it’s a way of being that’s rooted in our South African identity. “I am because we are” means that when one person struggles, we all feel it, and when one person thrives, we all rise. In leadership, this translates into service: my role isn’t to command from above, but to create the conditions where my teams can succeed together, with dignity and mutual respect.________________________________________
Where do you see Ubuntu values (community, mutual support, collective responsibility) in your IT department?
Your answer:
The culture of covering shifts, sharing knowledge, and celebrating collective wins is Ubuntu in action. 
In IT leadership, this translates to servant leadership: my role isn’t to command, but to enable my teams to succeed together.

QUESTION 2: Collaboration Challenges
What are the biggest challenges your IT department faces with collaboration across teams?
Your answer:
Our biggest challenge is the gap between procedural compliance and relational accountability. We have systems and ticketing workflows, but too often, people treat sending an email as the end of their responsibility. They assume that once a message is sent, the issue is “handled”—even if it’s 4 a.m. and no one has acknowledged it. This creates dangerous delays
Compounding this is a culture in some specialist teams where knowledge is treated as power. When interns ask for help, they’re sometimes met with impatience (“Have you traced the cable?”) rather than mentorship. Too often, we default to interrogation instead of support, which discourages learning and breeds hesitation and disconnect.
________________________________________
Can you give a specific example of when collaboration was particularly difficult?
Your answer:
A clear example is a disk space alert we received. Response was quick and noted that space had recovered by the IT Support Tech on shift, but no one followed up to understand why it happened or whether it would recur. 
The failure wasn’t technical -Service Desk saw it as “Infrastructure’s problem.” Infrastructure assumed it was resolved.

QUESTION 3: Current Tools & Gaps
Do your current IT management tools understand how your department actually works (relationships between teams, hierarchy, decision-making)?
Your answer:
No, they don’t. Our tools assume a linear, hierarchical workflow: ticket logged, escalated, resolved. But real IT work is dynamic, cross-functional, and often urgent. It often requires the team to be dynamic and think outside the box, and for management to be flexible. This is where I see true individual leadership arise in members. 
We get things done despite the tools, not because of them.
________________________________________
What do these tools miss or get wrong?
Your answer:
They miss context, urgency, and human nuance.
A terminal outage on the floor and a back-office printer failure may share the same priority label, but their business impact is worlds apart. Tools don’t distinguish between them—and they certainly don’t reflect who can solve a problem with the most efficiency.

QUESTION 4: Ubuntu-AI Concept
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
As part of my Honours research, I designed and built UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence) - a prototype multi-agent AI system mirroring your IT structure. This is a research artifact - not a commercial product - created to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can help bridge gaps between AI capabilities and real IT department operations.
The prototype has six AI agents mirroring the IT department structure:
- IT Manager Agent
- Service Desk Manager Agent
- IT Support Agent
- Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents
Each agent is designed to embody Ubuntu principles:	
- Help each other across teams
- Share solutions, not blame
- Ask for input, not just command
- Explain clearly what they're doing
This research investigates WHETHER this Ubuntu-driven approach can address collaboration gaps in IT departments. Your perspective helps validate or challenge this design concept.
________________________________________
Based on your experience with IT collaboration challenges:
Does this Ubuntu-driven design approach sound like it could help, or does it sound impractical?
Your answer:
It sounds both necessary and feasible—if it’s grounded in our operational reality. An AI that actively bridges gaps—by correlating monitoring alerts with tickets, prompting phone calls for off-hours Priority 1 incidents, and guiding junior staff with patience—could restore the relational accountability we’re missing. ________________________________________
What would this design need to get right to actually be useful in your daily work?
Your answer:
It must understand our operational context: that floor uptime equals revenue. It should integrate monitoring and ticketing data to eliminate blind spots and always explain its reasoning clearly.
________________________________________
What concerns do you have about this approach?
Your answer:
My primary concern is perception. If leadership positions this as a cost-cutting tool, it will destroy trust. AI should free experienced staff from routine tasks so they can mentor and innovate—not replace them. I’m also wary of over-idealism. Ubuntu isn’t about being “nice”; it’s about firm accountability delivered with care. If the AI avoids hard truths to appear collaborative, it fails its purpose.________________________________________
QUESTION 5: Trust & Authority
As IT Manager, what would make you trust or distrust a system like this?
Your answer:
I’d trust it if it gave me clear reasoning, allowed overrides, and maintained audit trails for compliance. I’d distrust it if it became a black box - especially for decisions affecting gaming operations or regulatory requirements.
________________________________________
Would it respect your decision-making authority? How should it interact with you?
Your answer:
I’d trust it if it provided transparent reasoning, allowed human overrides, and maintained full audit trails for compliance. I’d distrust it if it became a black box—especially for decisions affecting gaming operations or regulatory requirements.
________________________________________
QUESTION 6: Cultural vs. Technical
How important is it that AI embodies cultural values like Ubuntu versus just being technically efficient?
Your answer:
In this environment, it’s essential. Technical efficiency without Ubuntu leads to what we see now: correct but cold responses that fracture relationships. Ubuntu-aligned AI would model the behaviour we need - firm on standards, kind in delivery.
________________________________________
Does the cultural framing make a difference in technology adoption?
Your answer:
Yes. Individuals and societies perceive, evaluate, and integrate new technologies. Culture acts as a lens, influencing adoption rates based on shared values, beliefs, social norms, and communication styles. For South African staff who understands these roots, that’s legitimacy - not lip service.
________________________________________
QUESTION 7: Advice for Others
If another IT Manager was considering this approach, what’s the most important thing they should know?
Your answer:
Start with culture, not code. If your teams already have pockets of Ubuntu - amplify them. Don’t expect AI to create collaboration where none exists.
I always like to say, “Keep your best workers happy, and they will deliver”.
________________________________________
What would make it succeed or fail?
Your answer:
It succeeds with leadership commitment to augmentation (not replacement), co-design with frontline staff, and deep domain customization. It fails if rolled out as a top-down efficiency tool that ignores context.
________________________________________
What’s unique to your organization versus universal to IT departments?
Your answer:
We operate under 24/7 revenue pressure, strict gaming compliance, and a legacy-modern hybrid infrastructure. Generic IT solutions won’t survive here.
________________________________________
QUESTION 8: Final Thoughts
Is there anything about IT collaboration, Ubuntu philosophy, or AI integration that we haven’t discussed but you think is important?
Your answer:
Technology serves humanity. The AI is secondary. The humanity is primary.
