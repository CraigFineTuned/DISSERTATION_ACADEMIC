QUESTION 1: Ubuntu in Your Own Words
How would you describe Ubuntu philosophy in your own words?
(If you’re not familiar: Ubuntu means “I am because we are” - we become who we are through our relationships with others.)
Your answer:
Ubuntu is not something I learned at work—it’s what my mother taught me before I started school. She’d say, “Umntu ngumntu ngabantu”—a person is a person through other people. It means your dignity is tied to mine. In IT, that doesn’t mean we hold hands and sing; it means when a colleague is under pressure, you see it, and you act. You don’t wait to be asked. You don’t calculate whether it’s “your job.” You simply do what’s needed to keep the team—and the business—moving forward. 
________________________________________
Do you see Ubuntu values (helping each other, team support, collective responsibility) in how the IT team works together?
Your answer:
We know the floor can’t wait. The guest experience can’t wait. So we move as one. So we improvise.

QUESTION 2: Daily Frustrations
What frustrates you most about collaboration in IT - like getting information you need or coordinating with other teams?
Your answer:
The biggest frustration is when collaboration stops at the team boundary. Within Service Desk, we share everything—fixes, warnings, lessons. But when we escalate to specialists, sometimes it feels like we’re speaking a different language. They want perfect diagnostics, but they don’t always share context in return. If a system is known to be unstable during floor transactions—as the SQL job is—they should proactively warn us, not wait for us to fail first. 
________________________________________
Can you give a specific example of when collaboration was difficult?
Your answer:
During the Sliding Window SQL job failures, we kept getting alerts, but no one from the vendor side explained that it was expected during peak transactions. We escalated, investigated, worried—only to be told later, “Oh, that’s normal.” That’s not collaboration; that’s asymmetry. If they’d said upfront, “This job times out when the floor is busy—don’t panic,” we could’ve monitored instead of troubleshooting. 
________________________________________
What would make your daily work easier?
Your answer:
hared visibility. If it could show us, in real time, which systems are under known stress—like the marketing meter table during high-roller events—we wouldn’t waste time chasing ghosts. Also, a culture where specialists see us not as “noise,” but as their eyes and ears on the ground.

QUESTION 3: When Things Go Wrong
When there’s an incident or problem, how does the team handle it?
Your answer:
No panic, no blame, just focused action. Someone handles comms, someone digs into logs, someone updates stakeholders. Roles shift based on who’s available and capable—not titles. 
________________________________________
Is it more “whose fault is this?” or “how do we fix it together?”
Your answer:
Always “fix it together.” Blame doesn’t restore a slot machine or unlock a password.

QUESTION 4: Research Artifact – UGENTIC-AI Concept
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
As part of my Honours research, I designed and built a prototype multi-agent AI system mirroring your IT structure, called UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence). This is a research artifact - not a commercial product - created to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can help bridge gaps between AI capabilities and real IT department operations.
The prototype has six AI agents mirroring the IT department structure:
- IT Manager Agent 
- Service Desk Manager Agent 
- IT Support Agent 
- Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents 
Each agent is designed to embody Ubuntu principles: 
- Help each other across teams 
- Share solutions, not blame 
- Ask for input, not just command 
- Explain clearly what they're doing 
This research investigates WHETHER this Ubuntu-driven approach can address collaboration gaps in IT departments. Your perspective helps validate or challenge this design concept.
________________________________________
Based on your experience with IT collaboration challenges:
Does this Ubuntu-driven design approach sound like it could help, or does it sound impractical? 
Your answer:
It sounds like the missing thread. An AI that doesn’t just route tickets but connects context—like linking a cage terminal outage to a known database lock during floor transactions—could prevent so much wasted effort. And if it models the behavior we value—proactive support, clear explanation, no ego—it could even influence how others collaborate. 
________________________________________
What would this design need to get right to actually be useful in your daily work?
Your answer:
Share knowledge bidirectionally and not just “here’s the fix,” but “here’s why it happened”. Understand our rhythm and peak hours, events, compliance deadlines.
________________________________________
What concerns do you have about this approach?
Your answer:
It becomes another layer of bureaucracy. Ubuntu isn’t a process—it’s a posture. If UGENTIC requires ten clicks to “collaborate,” it fails. Also, if it’s used to replace human judgment in high-stakes moments, it will erode trust. AI should amplify our humanity, not automate it away. 
________________________________________
QUESTION 5: Trust & Usefulness
What would make you trust this system versus ignore it or not trust it?
Your answer:
If it proves it’s on the team’s side. If it helps me help others faster—like auto-suggesting the right specialist with their current workload status—I’ll trust it. But if it starts second-guessing frontline judgment without context, I’ll ignore it like I ignore false-positive alerts. 
________________________________________
How would you want to interact with it? (Chat? Dashboard? Something else?)
Your answer:
A chat interface that feels like a senior colleague: “Hey, I see you’re on ticket #5129. The SQL job failed again—but it’s likely floor traffic. Monitor for 30 mins before escalating.” And a dashboard showing system health with business impact.
________________________________________
Would it respect your expertise or talk down to you?
Your answer:
I’ve walked these floors for years. I know when a guest is frustrated, when a manager is stressed, when a system is lying. Don’t tell me “as per procedure.” Tell me “here’s what I see—what’s your take?” That’s respect.
________________________________________
QUESTION 6: Final Thoughts
Is there anything about IT work, team collaboration, or AI that we haven’t talked about but you think I should know?
Your answer:
Ubuntu isn’t about being liked. It’s about being reliable. In our culture, your word is your bond. When I say I’ll fetch the register, I run. When I say I’ll monitor the job, I stay awake. That’s not servitude—it’s dignity in service.
If UGENTIC can reflect that spirit—not as a slogan, but as design—it won’t just improve IT. It will honour who we are.
Because in the end, technology doesn’t serve systems.
