QUESTION 1: Ubuntu in Your Own Words
How would you describe Ubuntu philosophy in your own words?
(If you’re not familiar: Ubuntu means “I am because we are” - we become who we are through our relationships with others.)
Your answer:
Ubuntu, to me, is the idea that we grow through each other. It’s not just about helping—it’s about creating space for someone to learn, make mistakes, and still feel valued. In IT, that means when I don’t know something, I shouldn’t be afraid to ask—and when someone asks me, I should answer with patience, not judgment. 
________________________________________
Do you see Ubuntu values (helping each other, team support, collective responsibility) in how the IT team works together?
Your answer:
Yes, especially in the Service Desk team where I am.

QUESTION 2: Daily Frustrations
What frustrates you most about collaboration in IT - like getting information you need or coordinating with other teams?
Your answer:
Not knowing what I don’t know. 
________________________________________
Can you give a specific example of when collaboration was difficult?
Your answer:
When I had to deal with an issue with network cable. I learned a user had yanked it from the ceiling, possibly damaging it. But no one warned me that could happen. If Infrastructure had said, “Cable moves require IT sign-off,” I’d have known to ask. 
________________________________________
What would make your daily work easier?
Your answer:
I’d start smarter. Also, a safe way to ask “dumb” questions without fear of public reply.

QUESTION 3: When Things Go Wrong
When there’s an incident or problem, how does the team handle it?
Your answer:
“Mistakes are data.” But when I escalate, I brace for tone. One sharp email can undo a week of confidence. 
________________________________________
Is it more “whose fault is this?” or “how do we fix it together?”
Your answer:
With my team: “fix together.” With specialists: “whose fault”—especially if I’m the intern.

QUESTION 4: Research Artifact – UGENTIC-AI Concept
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
As part of my Honours research, I designed and built a prototype multi-agent AI system mirroring your IT structure, called UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence). This is a research artifact - not a commercial product - created to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can help bridge gaps between AI capabilities and real IT department operations.
The prototype has six AI agents mirroring the IT department structure:
- IT Manager Agent 
- Service Desk Manager Agent 
- IT Support Agent 
- Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents 
Each agent is designed to embody Ubuntu principles: 
- Help each other across teams 
- Share solutions, not blame 
- Ask for input, not just command 
- Explain clearly what they're doing 
This research investigates WHETHER this Ubuntu-driven approach can address collaboration gaps in IT departments. Your perspective helps validate or challenge this design concept.
________________________________________
Based on your experience with IT collaboration challenges:
Does this Ubuntu-driven design approach sound like it could help, or does it sound impractical? 
Your answer:
It sounds like a mentor I can always reach. If it explains why a fix works—not just what to do—it helps me learn. And if it shields me from public blame while I’m still learning, that’s huge. 
________________________________________
What would this design need to get right to actually be useful in your daily work?
Your answer:
Guide each other.
________________________________________
What concerns do you have about this approach?
Your answer:
That it’ll be seen as a crutch. But we all start somewhere. AI shouldn’t replace human mentorship—but it can hold the space until a human is free.

QUESTION 5: Trust & Usefulness
What would make you trust this system versus ignore it or not trust it?
Your answer:
f it helps me look competent, not clueless. If it says, “You did X right—now try Y,” I’ll trust it. 
________________________________________
How would you want to interact with it? (Chat? Dashboard? Something else?)
Your answer:
Chat and dashboard with exact flow of our company.
________________________________________
Would it respect your expertise or talk down to you?
Your answer:
I have none yet—but I’m trying. Don’t say “As an intern, you should know.” Say “This is new—let’s walk through it.”
________________________________________
QUESTION 6: Final Thoughts
Is there anything about IT work, team collaboration, or AI that we haven’t talked about but you think I should know?
Your answer:
The biggest barrier isn’t skill—it’s fear. Fear of looking stupid for me.
