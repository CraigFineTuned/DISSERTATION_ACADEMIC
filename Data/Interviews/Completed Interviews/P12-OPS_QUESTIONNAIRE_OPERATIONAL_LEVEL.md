QUESTION 1: Ubuntu in Your Own Words
How would you describe Ubuntu philosophy in your own words?
(If you’re not familiar: Ubuntu means “I am because we are” - we become who we are through our relationships with others.)
Your answer:
Ubuntu is the belief that no one succeeds alone—and no problem is truly “someone else’s.” In IT, that means if the user can’t do their job, it’s everyone’s problem until it’s fixed. It’s not about who owns the system; it’s about who owns the outcome.
________________________________________
Do you see Ubuntu values (helping each other, team support, collective responsibility) in how the IT team works together?
Your answer:
In Service Desk, yes—deeply. But I’ve also spent time shadowing App Support, and I’ve seen how isolated they feel. They’re under constant pressure to keep systems stable, and every “dumb ticket” feels like a threat to that stability. So their defensiveness isn’t malice—it’s stress.
The problem isn’t that Ubuntu is absent; it’s that it’s not shared across the boundary. Service Desk lives it. Specialists could live it—but they don’t feel safe enough to.

QUESTION 2: Daily Frustrations
What frustrates you most about collaboration in IT - like getting information you need or coordinating with other teams?
Your answer:
The translation gap. Service Desk speaks “user impact.” Specialists speak “system metrics.” And no one bridges the two.
I’ll get a call: “The loyalty points aren’t loading on the kiosk!”
I log a ticket: “Player tracking kiosk unresponsive.”
App Support reads it as: “Frontend UI issue.”
But the real problem? A timeout in the authentication microservice—something only visible in their logs.
Without shared language, we talk past each other.
________________________________________
Can you give a specific example of when collaboration was difficult?
Your answer:
During a recent promotion, guests couldn’t redeem bonus points. Service Desk logged 50+ tickets. I knew from my shadowing that this was likely an API rate-limiting issue.
I escalated with notes: “Suspect API gateway throttling—check /loyalty/redeem endpoint.”
App Support replied: “Not reproducible in test. Must be client-side.”
But I knew it wasn’t—because I’d seen the error pattern before. I pushed back, politely. They escalated to their manager, who accused me of “overstepping.”
Hadley had to mediate. Turned out I was right—but the damage was done. Now App Support sees me as “that Level 1 who thinks he’s a dev.” 
________________________________________
What would make your daily work easier?
Your answer:
A system that translates across domains. Not just “ticket → specialist,” but “user symptom → technical layer → business impact.” And if it could validate hybrid knowledge—like mine—instead of punishing it, that would help too.
________________________________________
QUESTION 3: When Things Go Wrong
When there’s an incident or problem, how does the team handle it?
Your answer:
In Service Desk: we focus on user impact first, root cause later.
In App Support: they focus on system integrity first, user experience later.
Neither is wrong—but without alignment, we waste time.
________________________________________
Is it more “whose fault is this?” or “how do we fix it together?”
Your answer:
It depends on who’s in the room.
If it’s just Service Desk: “Fix it together.”
If specialists are involved: “Whose fault” emerges within minutes—especially if reputations are on the line.
But I’ve seen it work both ways. Once, during a major outage, the App lead said in the war room: “I don’t care whose system it is—just tell me what you see.” That changed everything.
So the potential is there. It just needs permission to collaborate.

QUESTION 4: Research Artifact – UGENTIC-AI Concept
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
As part of my Honours research, I designed and built a prototype multi-agent AI system mirroring your IT structure, called UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence). This is a research artifact - not a commercial product - created to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can help bridge gaps between AI capabilities and real IT department operations.
The prototype has six AI agents mirroring the IT department structure:
- IT Manager Agent 
- Service Desk Manager Agent 
- IT Support Agent 
- Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents 
Each agent is designed to embody Ubuntu principles: 
- Help each other across teams 
- Share solutions, not blame 
- Ask for input, not just command 
- Explain clearly what they're doing 
This research investigates WHETHER this Ubuntu-driven approach can address collaboration gaps in IT departments. Your perspective helps validate or challenge this design concept.
________________________________________
Based on your experience with IT collaboration challenges:
Does this Ubuntu-driven design approach sound like it could help, or does it sound impractical? 
Your answer:
It sounds necessary. An AI that doesn’t care about team labels—only about the user journey—could be the neutral translator we lack. If it can look at a kiosk failure and say, “This matches a known API timeout pattern; here’s the log snippet App Support needs,” it removes guesswork and ego.
________________________________________
What would this design need to get right to actually be useful in your daily work?
Your answer:
Map user symptoms to technical layers (e.g., “kiosk freeze” → “API gateway timeout”) and recognize when a tech has relevant training and skills.
________________________________________
What concerns do you have about this approach?
Your answer:
That it’ll be seen as a threat by specialists who guard their domain knowledge. Or that it’ll oversimplify complex issues. Also, if it’s not updated when apps change, it’ll give outdated advice—and then no one will trust it.
________________________________________
QUESTION 5: Trust & Usefulness
What would make you trust this system versus ignore it or not trust it?
Your answer:
If it respects the complexity of our systems while making them accessible. If it says, “This is likely X, but check Y because App v3.x changed the auth flow,” that shows depth.
________________________________________
How would you want to interact with it? (Chat? Dashboard? Something else?)
Your answer:
Chat for real-time triage. Dashboard for trend analysis—like “Top 5 recurring cross-team issues this month.”

________________________________________
Would it respect your expertise or talk down to you?
Your answer:
I’m not a developer, but I’m not clueless either. Don’t say, “As a support tech, you wouldn’t understand.” Say, “Here’s the technical detail—let me explain it in context.” That’s respect. 
________________________________________
QUESTION 6: Final Thoughts
Is there anything about IT work, team collaboration, or AI that we haven’t talked about but you think I should know?
Your answer:
The biggest untapped resource in this department is people who straddle boundaries—like me. We’re not rare, but we’re not valued. Management sees us as “not specialist enough,” and specialists see us as “not technical enough.”
But we’re the connective tissue.
If UGENTIC can amplify our role—give us tools to translate, validate our insights, protect us from backlash—it won’t just improve collaboration. It’ll unlock hidden capacity.
