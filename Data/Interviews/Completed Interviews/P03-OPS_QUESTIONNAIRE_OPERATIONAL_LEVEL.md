QUESTION 1: Ubuntu in Your Own Words
How would you describe Ubuntu philosophy in your own words?
(If you’re not familiar: Ubuntu means “I am because we are” - we become who we are through our relationships with others.)
Your answer:
Ubuntu, as I understand it, is the idea that we’re all connected—that my success depends on yours, and vice versa. In a technical environment, that doesn’t mean lowering standards or avoiding accountability. It means solving problems together, with clarity and respect. If a system fails, we fix it as a unit, but we also ensure it doesn’t happen again through proper design, documentation, and discipline. Ubuntu isn’t about being soft; it’s about being responsible—to the team, to the systems, and to the business.
________________________________________
Do you see Ubuntu values (helping each other, team support, collective responsibility) in how the IT team works together?
Your answer:
[Space for answer]

QUESTION 2: Daily Frustrations
What frustrates you most about collaboration in IT - like getting information you need or coordinating with other teams?
Your answer:
When it comes to cross-team collaboration, Ubuntu often breaks down with service desk and tech level. Too many escalations come through without basic diagnostics: no ping results, no traceroute, no switchport status. It’s not that I mind helping—it’s that effective collaboration requires baseline competence. If someone hasn’t even checked whether a cable is plugged in, how can we troubleshoot as equals? Ubuntu assumes mutual effort, not one-sided rescue.
________________________________________
Can you give a specific example of when collaboration was difficult?
Your answer:
Recently, an intern logged a ticket about “no connectivity” for a relocated STB. He hadn’t traced the cable, hadn’t checked the switchport, and didn’t verify if the port was even enabled. When I asked, “Have you traced the cable to the hub room?”—which he’d been shown how to do—he seemed surprised. Meanwhile, Slots Tech had moved the cable without IT approval, possibly damaging the termination. Now Infrastructure has to repair it, and the business bears the cost. This wasn’t a network failure—it was a process failure. And when I pointed that out, it was framed as “blame,” not accountability.
________________________________________
What would make your daily work easier?
Your answer:
A system that enforces minimum diagnostic standards before escalation. If a ticket comes in for network issues, it should auto-prompt the submitter to run basic checks—ping gateway, verify physical link, check switchport status—and attach the output. That way, we start from data, not guesswork. Also, clearer boundaries: if Slots Tech wants to move infrastructure, they need IT sign-off first. Otherwise, we’re always cleaning up after avoidable damage.

QUESTION 3: When Things Go Wrong
When there’s an incident or problem, how does the team handle it?
Your answer:
Within Network, we operate with precision: isolate, diagnose, resolve, document. But cross-team, it’s inconsistent. Some incidents trigger war-room collaboration; others devolve into email chains with growing CC lists. The moment management gets looped in unnecessarily, the focus shifts from resolution to reputation management.
________________________________________
Is it more “whose fault is this?” or “how do we fix it together?”
Your answer:
Ideally, it should be “fix it together”—but only if everyone brings their due diligence to the table. If a junior tech escalates without doing basic checks, and then gets grilled, it’s not blame culture—it’s consequence culture. In high-stakes environments like ours, accountability isn’t optional. That said, the tone matters. I’d never shame someone publicly—but I will insist on standards. Ubuntu doesn’t mean lowering the bar; it means lifting each other to meet it.

QUESTION 4: Research Artifact – UGENTIC-AI Concept
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
As part of my Honours research, I designed and built a prototype multi-agent AI system mirroring your IT structure, called UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence). This is a research artifact - not a commercial product - created to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can help bridge gaps between AI capabilities and real IT department operations.
The prototype has six AI agents mirroring the IT department structure:
- IT Manager Agent 
- Service Desk Manager Agent 
- IT Support Agent 
- Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents 
Each agent is designed to embody Ubuntu principles: 
- Help each other across teams 
- Share solutions, not blame 
- Ask for input, not just command 
- Explain clearly what they're doing 
This research investigates WHETHER this Ubuntu-driven approach can address collaboration gaps in IT departments. Your perspective helps validate or challenge this design concept.
________________________________________
Based on your experience with IT collaboration challenges:
Does this Ubuntu-driven design approach sound like it could help, or does it sound impractical? 
Your answer:
It could help—if it’s designed with technical rigor, not just “nice” intentions. An AI that understands network topology, correlates monitoring alerts with ticket data, and validates escalations before routing them would reduce noise and false positives. If it can explain issues in plain language without sacrificing accuracy—like translating a BGP flap into “external routing instability affecting player tracking”—that’s valuable.
________________________________________
What would this design need to get right to actually be useful in your daily work?
Your answer:
•	Deep integration with network monitoring tools (e.g., Sourcing, switch logs)
•	Context-aware prioritization: know that a cage terminal outage trumps a back-office Wi-Fi complaint
•	Pre-validation of escalations: auto-check if basic diagnostics were performed
•	Clear, factual communication: no sugarcoating, but no jargon without explanation
________________________________________
What concerns do you have about this approach?
Your answer:
That it becomes a “dumbing down” tool—masking complexity instead of teaching it. Also, if it’s used to justify reducing specialist roles, it will backfire. Network engineering isn’t just fixing links; it’s designing resilient, secure, compliant infrastructure. AI can’t replace that judgment.
________________________________________
QUESTION 5: Trust & Usefulness
What would make you trust this system versus ignore it or not trust it?
Your answer:
Prove it understands networking. If it misdiagnoses a VLAN misconfiguration as a physical layer issue, I’ll never trust it again. But if it correctly identifies a spanning-tree loop from switch logs and suggests disabling portfast on access ports? I’ll use it daily. Accuracy builds trust—not friendliness. 
________________________________________
How would you want to interact with it? (Chat? Dashboard? Something else?)
Your answer:
A dashboard showing real-time topology maps with ticket overlays, plus a CLI-style chat for quick queries: “UGENTIC, show me recent errors on Gi1/0/24.” 
________________________________________
Would it respect your expertise or talk down to you?
Your answer:
It better respect it. I don’t need an AI telling me how to subnet. But if it says, “This latency pattern matches a known QoS issue on player tracking VLANs—want the config template?”—that’s collaboration. Tone should be peer-to-peer, not patronizing. 
________________________________________
QUESTION 6: Final Thoughts
Is there anything about IT work, team collaboration, or AI that we haven’t talked about but you think I should know?
Your answer:
People confuse accountability with ego. When I ask for diagnostics, it’s not because I think I’m superior—it’s because I respect the urgency of the problem and the intelligence of my colleagues. We’re all professionals. Ubuntu in a technical team means holding each other to high standards with support, not instead of it.
Also, stop treating Network like a utility. We’re not just “the pipe.” We’re the nervous system of this casino. If UGENTIC can reflect that gravity—while still enabling collaboration—it has real potential. But if it’s just another layer of abstraction that hides complexity, it’ll fail.
