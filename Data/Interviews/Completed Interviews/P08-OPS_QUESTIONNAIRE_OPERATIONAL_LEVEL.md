QUESTION 1: Ubuntu in Your Own Words
How would you describe Ubuntu philosophy in your own words?
(If you’re not familiar: Ubuntu means “I am because we are” - we become who we are through our relationships with others.)
Your answer:
I would describe it as the collective effort that has been put in by multiple different parties in the development of an individual
________________________________________
Do you see Ubuntu values (helping each other, team support, collective responsibility) in how the IT team works together?
Your answer:
I do see it most of the time yes, however there are times when it moves from “I am because we are” to “All for One and none for all”

QUESTION 2: Daily Frustrations
What frustrates you most about collaboration in IT - like getting information you need or coordinating with other teams?
Your answer:
The most frustrating aspect of the job in regard to collaboration would be communication between the different team members and different Units. At times it is good but other times you’ll need to send an email/follow up before things get done.
________________________________________
Can you give a specific example of when collaboration was difficult?
Your answer:
When there is an issue regarding our gaming floor over the weekend and we need to organize the team into who’s testing, where they are testing and who stays in the office and what they should be doing, it becomes a bit messy since the on-site team is dealing with both a major issue and smaller issues which occur at the same time
________________________________________
What would make your daily work easier?
Your answer:
Daily work could be made easier through a more specific Call Logging system which can automatically relate incidents which are similar together so that the resolution of the previous tickets can be seen by the logger which could reduce troubleshooting times as well as provide some stress relief
________________________________________
QUESTION 3: When Things Go Wrong
When there’s an incident or problem, how does the team handle it?
Your answer:
When issues arise the team will first determine what the issue is and what the scope is of the issue, this lays the groundwork for whether or not the issue should be escalated or if the responding member can resolve it themselves. Once that is determined and the initial troubleshooting completed the call will either be resolved or escalated to the 2nd level of support
________________________________________
Is it more “whose fault is this?” or “how do we fix it together?”
Your answer:
It’s a bit of both depending on the issue at hand and which teams are involved with resolving the issue, once the issue moves from being just a local issue to one where HO (Head Office) needs to be involved it becomes more of a “Whose fault is this”
Locally there’s not too much of a fuss about blaming people, when it comes to the extent of issuing warnings or disciplinaries, but what does get called into question a lot of the time is “Should someone else have been able to fix this issue” mainly for tickets which are logged and left untouched by the logger/not enough effort put into it

QUESTION 4: Research Artifact – UGENTIC-AI Concept
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
As part of my Honours research, I designed and built a prototype multi-agent AI system mirroring your IT structure, called UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence). This is a research artifact - not a commercial product - created to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can help bridge gaps between AI capabilities and real IT department operations.
The prototype has six AI agents mirroring the IT department structure:
- IT Manager Agent 
- Service Desk Manager Agent 
- IT Support Agent 
- Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents 
Each agent is designed to embody Ubuntu principles: 
- Help each other across teams 
- Share solutions, not blame 
- Ask for input, not just command 
- Explain clearly what they're doing 
This research investigates WHETHER this Ubuntu-driven approach can address collaboration gaps in IT departments. Your perspective helps validate or challenge this design concept.
________________________________________
Based on your experience with IT collaboration challenges:
Does this Ubuntu-driven design approach sound like it could help, or does it sound impractical? 
Your answer:
This sort of model could work as long as it’s integrated well into a system, if the solution sharing is buried within a dashboard or is 4 clicks too many away from the initial logging of a ticket/viewing of a logged ticket
________________________________________
What would this design need to get right to actually be useful in your daily work?
Your answer:
Being able to reason based on the context clues provided within tickets, e.g. call priority, SLAs, quick fixes or escalate-able problems/where to escalate to. Also being able to explain the reasoning clearly to the human on the other side would help in garnering a trust between the AI and the person using the system 
________________________________________
What concerns do you have about this approach?
Your answer:
The main issue I could see is that the AI does not have the capability to properly use the context within a ticket to provide accurate/related solutions 
________________________________________
QUESTION 5: Trust & Usefulness
What would make you trust this system versus ignore it or not trust it?
Your answer:
I would need a live demo of how the system operates and creates its suggestions/what it can bring to the table in terms of assisting with an issue
________________________________________
How would you want to interact with it? (Chat? Dashboard? Something else?)
Your answer:
I would like for it to be a selectable menu for smaller more common issues and a sort of search engine for issues that are more complex and might relate to the business specifically e.g. drop downs that deal with major categories first and then sub issues 
Computer Software ->Microsoft -> Outlook -> Inbox -> Layout
“The casino floor is down and we’ve received alerts that the physical servers are down but they look like they’re on, please help”
________________________________________
Would it respect your expertise or talk down to you?
Your answer:
After it has assisted me with resolving issues and cutting down troubleshooting times I would trust it but for a period I would have to first scrutinize all it’s suggestions and assistance it provides and see how well they link to actual performance increases
________________________________________
QUESTION 6: Final Thoughts
Is there anything about IT work, team collaboration, or AI that we haven’t talked about but you think I should know?
Your answer:
The ability for people to rate solutions and the tools provided would be a good addition if it’s not been considered already
