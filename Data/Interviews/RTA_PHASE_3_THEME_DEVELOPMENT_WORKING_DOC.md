## PHASE 3 OBJECTIVES

**Following Braun & Clarke (2024) RTA Guidelines:**

**Phase 3: Searching for Themes**
1. Collate codes into potential themes
2. Gather all data relevant to each candidate theme
3. Consider relationships between codes, between themes, and between levels of themes
4. Begin to develop a thematic map
5. Maintain reflexive awareness of interpretive decisions

**Process for This Research:**
- Collate all codes from 14 participants (Phase 2 complete)
- Identify patterns across strategic, tactical, and operational levels
- Cluster codes into candidate themes
- Map theme relationships and sub-themes
- Validate themes against full dataset
- Refine and name themes for Chapter 5 presentation

## SECTION 2: CANDIDATE THEMES IDENTIFIED

### **THEME 1: THE GREAT DIVIDE - Cultural Schism as Fundamental Gap**

**Definition:** A documented cultural fragmentation between Service Desk (Ubuntu-aligned, collaborative, solution-focused) and Specialist teams (ego-driven, blame-focused, knowledge-hoarding), creating a two-culture organization where Ubuntu exists but is compartmentalized rather than absent.

**Sub-Themes:**
- 1.1 Service Desk Ubuntu Culture (collaborative, empathetic, team-first)
- 1.2 Specialist Ego Culture (blame, gatekeeping, public shaming)
- 1.3 Historical Erosion (P07: 2000 integrated → 2025 compartmentalized)
- 1.4 Translation Gap (P12: "user impact" vs "system metrics" languages)
- 1.5 Boundary Crossing Punishment (correct escalations punished)

**Evidence Strength:** 12/14 participants directly reference this divide

**Defining Quotes:**
- "Ubuntu compartmentalized: Strong in Service Desk. Weak everywhere else" (P07)
- "My team focuses on solving; they focus on 'whose fault'" (P02)
- "Service Desk speaks 'user impact.' Specialists speak 'system metrics'" (P12)
- "Some have all the rungs, some told to climb barefoot" (P14)

**RQ Mapping:**
- **RQ1 (Gap Manifestations):** Cultural schism = primary gap manifestation
- **RQ2 (Ubuntu Bridging):** Ubuntu present but fragmented = bridging opportunity
- **RQ4 (Organizational Factors):** Cultural divide = major constraint to AI adoption

**Theoretical Contributions:**
- Organizational culture can be fragmented within same organization
- Ubuntu exists in pockets, not uniformly absent or present
- Technology adoption shaped by cultural schisms
- Boundary spanners critical but punished role

---

### **THEME 2: UBUNTU AUTHENTICITY - Restoration Not Creation**

**Definition:** Ubuntu philosophy is culturally authentic and present within the organization (especially Service Desk level), but has eroded and compartmentalized over 25 years. UGENTIC's role is cultural RESTORATION rather than foreign concept introduction, reframing the research from "can Ubuntu bridge gaps" to "can technology help restore Ubuntu practices that existed but fragmented."

**Sub-Themes:**
- 2.1 Historical Ubuntu (P07: 2000 documentation)
- 2.2 Service Desk as Ubuntu Stronghold (cultural carrier)
- 2.3 Ubuntu Fragmentation (compartmentalized, not absent)
- 2.4 Restoration Imperative ("remembering who we are")
- 2.5 Genuine vs Performative Ubuntu (dignity vs sentiment)

**Evidence Strength:** 8/14 participants, including critical P07 longitudinal evidence

**Defining Quotes:**
- **"Don't call it 'AI collaboration.' Call it 'remembering who we are'"** (P07 - CRITICAL)
- "When I started in '00, Network and Apps sat with us. We ate lunch together. Now? They're in their own bubble" (P07)
- "What makes it genuine is that I can see these principles already working in my Service Desk team" (P02)
- "Ubuntu isn't about being 'nice'; it's about firm accountability delivered with care" (P01)

**RQ Mapping:**
- **RQ2 (Ubuntu Bridging):** Ubuntu culturally authentic = bridging feasibility confirmed
- **RQ3 (Practitioner Perceptions):** Restoration framing increases receptivity
- **RQ4 (Organizational Factors):** Historical Ubuntu = enabling factor

**Theoretical Contributions:**
- Ubuntu-AI research reframed: restoration vs creation
- Longitudinal organizational culture trajectory documented
- Cultural erosion can be reversed with technological support
- Authenticity prerequisite for philosophical AI design

**CRITICAL RESEARCH IMPACT:** This theme transforms the dissertation from "introducing Ubuntu" to "restoring Ubuntu"—a fundamentally different research contribution with deeper organizational and philosophical legitimacy.

---

### **THEME 3: CULTURE-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION - Technology Serves Humanity**

**Definition:** Successful AI-organizational integration requires cultural prerequisites before technical deployment. Technology cannot create collaboration where none exists; it can only amplify, model, or restore existing cultural values. The AI is secondary; the humanity is primary.

**Sub-Themes:**
- 3.1 Start with Culture, Not Code (P01 principle)
- 3.2 Technology Serves Humanity (philosophical grounding)
- 3.3 Collaboration Prerequisite (AI cannot create culture)
- 3.4 Firm Accountability with Care (Ubuntu authenticity)
- 3.5 Humility vs Hierarchy Design (P14 requirement)

**Evidence Strength:** 10/14 participants emphasize culture-first approach

**Defining Quotes:**
- **"Start with culture, not code. Don't expect AI to create collaboration where none exists"** (P01 - FOUNDATIONAL)
- **"Technology serves humanity. The AI is secondary. The humanity is primary"** (P01 - PHILOSOPHICAL)
- "Ubuntu isn't about being 'nice'; it's about firm accountability delivered with care" (P01)
- "Built with humility, not hierarchy" (P14)
- "Don't call it 'AI collaboration.' Call it 'remembering who we are'" (P07)

**RQ Mapping:**
- **RQ2 (Ubuntu Bridging):** Culture-first approach = bridging prerequisite
- **RQ3 (Practitioner Perceptions):** Cultural legitimacy increases receptivity
- **RQ4 (Organizational Factors):** Cultural readiness = critical enabler

**Theoretical Contributions:**
- Technology adoption theory: cultural prerequisites for sociotechnical systems
- Ubuntu philosophy applied to AI design: humanity-first principle
- Challenges technology determinism narratives
- Establishes philosophical grounding for AI-organizational integration

**Design Implications:**
- Assess organizational culture BEFORE AI deployment
- Frame AI as cultural enabler, not cultural creator
- Model desired behaviors through AI design
- Balance accountability and care in AI interactions

---

### **THEME 4: TRUST PREREQUISITES - Augmentation Framing Non-Negotiable**

**Definition:** Trust in AI is universally contingent on transparent augmentation framing rather than replacement positioning. Across all three organizational levels and 14 participants, the fear of replacement is immediate, pervasive, and adoption-blocking. Trust requires transparency, explainability, and clear augmentation intent from leadership.

**Sub-Themes:**
- 4.1 Replacement Fear (universal across all 14 participants)
- 4.2 Augmentation Framing Critical (support vs replace)
- 4.3 Implementation Politics (leadership messaging determines trust)
- 4.4 Transparency Requirement (explainability non-negotiable)
- 4.5 Cost-Cutting Framing Risk (destroys trust immediately)

**Evidence Strength:** 14/14 participants - UNIVERSAL finding

**Defining Quotes:**
- "If leadership positions this as a cost-cutting tool, it will destroy trust" (P01)
- "My biggest concern is the replacement of staff" (P02)
- "Will it replace people or help them?" (P04)
- "Won't replace us but will ACTUALLY be there at 2am" (P11)
- "Another tool that judges me, or helps me grow?" (P13)
- "Assumes I'm lazy, not lost" (P14)

**RQ Mapping:**
- **RQ3 (Practitioner Perceptions):** Replacement fear = universal perception barrier
- **RQ4 (Organizational Factors):** Leadership framing = critical adoption factor

**Theoretical Contributions:**
- Trust threshold documented across all organizational levels
- Framing determines technology adoption success/failure
- Replacement fear more powerful than potential benefits
- Implementation politics > technical features for adoption

**Design Implications:**
- Leadership must explicitly frame AI as augmentation
- Transparency and explainability mandatory features
- Avoid cost-cutting or efficiency extraction narratives
- Position AI as support tool, mentorship supplement, knowledge democratizer

## SECTION 3: THEMATIC MAP - RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEMES

### **3.1 HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE**

```
OVERARCHING INSIGHT: Ubuntu-AI as Cultural Restoration in Fragmented Organization

    │
    ├── THEME 1: THE GREAT DIVIDE (Fundamental Gap)
    │       └── Why AI is needed: Cultural schism creates collaboration failure
    │
    ├── THEME 2: UBUNTU AUTHENTICITY (Foundation)
    │       └── Why AI can succeed: Ubuntu culturally authentic but fragmented
    │
    ├── THEME 3: CULTURE-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION (Design Principle)
    │       └── How AI must be designed: Technology serves humanity, not replaces
    │
    └── THEME 4: TRUST PREREQUISITES (Adoption Condition)
            └── What determines success: Augmentation framing, transparency, leadership
```

### **3.2 THEME INTERDEPENDENCIES**

**Theme 1 → Theme 2:**
The Great Divide reveals Ubuntu compartmentalization (Theme 2). Service Desk maintains Ubuntu culture; Specialists lost it. This proves Ubuntu is authentic (Theme 2) but fragmented (Theme 1).

**Theme 2 → Theme 3:**
Ubuntu Authenticity enables Culture-First Implementation (Theme 3). Because Ubuntu already exists, AI can restore rather than create. "Remembering who we are" (P07) grounds "start with culture, not code" (P01).

**Theme 3 → Theme 4:**
Culture-First Implementation requires Trust Prerequisites (Theme 4). Technology serving humanity (Theme 3) must be perceived as augmentation, not replacement (Theme 4). Leadership framing (Theme 4) determines whether culture-first approach (Theme 3) succeeds.

**Theme 4 → Theme 1:**
Trust Prerequisites address The Great Divide (Theme 1). Specialists' gatekeeping creates replacement fears. Transparent augmentation framing can bridge cultural schism by demonstrating AI supports all levels equally.

### **3.3 CIRCULAR VALIDATION**

Each theme validates and depends on others:
- Great Divide explains why restoration needed
- Ubuntu Authenticity proves restoration possible
- Culture-First principle defines restoration approach
- Trust Prerequisites ensure restoration accepted

**Research Coherence:** Four themes form complete narrative answering all RQs.

---

## SECTION 5: REFINED THEME DEFINITIONS FOR CHAPTER 5

### **FINAL THEME 1: THE GREAT DIVIDE**
**Refined Definition:** A documented cultural schism between Service Desk (Ubuntu-aligned: collaborative, empathetic, solution-focused) and Specialist teams (ego-driven: blame-focused, knowledge-hoarding, public-shaming), creating organizational fragmentation where Ubuntu culture exists but is compartmentalized rather than uniformly absent. This divide manifests in: (1) language differences ("user impact" vs "system metrics"), (2) behavioral norms (collaborative vs competitive), (3) knowledge practices (sharing vs hoarding), and (4) accountability approaches (firm-but-fair vs public blame).

**Chapter 5 Structure:**
- 5.X.1 Two Cultures Documented
- 5.X.2 Historical Erosion (P07 2000→2025)
- 5.X.3 Translation Gap & Boundary Spanners
- 5.X.4 Knowledge Gatekeeping as Power
- 5.X.5 Implications for AI Design

---

### **FINAL THEME 2: UBUNTU AUTHENTICITY - Restoration Not Creation**
**Refined Definition:** Ubuntu philosophy is culturally authentic within the South African casino operations context and demonstrably present at the Service Desk operational level. However, 25-year longitudinal evidence reveals Ubuntu has eroded and compartmentalized rather than disappeared. UGENTIC's research contribution shifts from "introducing Ubuntu-AI" to "restoring fragmented Ubuntu through technology"—reframing the dissertation as cultural restoration project with deeper philosophical and organizational legitimacy.

**Chapter 5 Structure:**
- 5.X.1 Cultural Authenticity Confirmed
- 5.X.2 Service Desk as Ubuntu Stronghold
- 5.X.3 Longitudinal Erosion (P07 Critical Evidence)
- 5.X.4 "Remembering Who We Are" (Restoration Imperative)
- 5.X.5 Genuine vs Performative Ubuntu
- 5.X.6 Research Reframing Impact

---

### **FINAL THEME 3: CULTURE-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION**
**Refined Definition:** Successful Ubuntu-AI integration requires cultural prerequisites before technical deployment. Technology cannot create collaboration where none exists—it can only amplify, model, or restore existing cultural values. This principle positions AI as cultural enabler rather than cultural creator, establishing humanity-first design philosophy where "the AI is secondary; the humanity is primary." Implementation requires balancing firm accountability with care, building with humility rather than hierarchy, and framing technology as supporting existing values rather than introducing foreign concepts.

**Chapter 5 Structure:**
- 5.X.1 "Start with Culture, Not Code" (Foundational Principle)
- 5.X.2 Technology Serves Humanity (Philosophical Grounding)
- 5.X.3 Collaboration Prerequisite (Cannot Create What Doesn't Exist)
- 5.X.4 Firm Accountability with Care (Ubuntu Authenticity)
- 5.X.5 Humility vs Hierarchy Design
- 5.X.6 Design Implications for UGENTIC

---

### **FINAL THEME 4: TRUST PREREQUISITES - Augmentation Framing Non-Negotiable**
**Refined Definition:** Trust in Ubuntu-AI is universally contingent on transparent augmentation framing. Across all 14 participants, three organizational levels, and diverse roles (veterans to interns, advocates to skeptics), replacement fear emerges as immediate, pervasive, and adoption-blocking. Trust requires: (1) explicit augmentation positioning by leadership, (2) transparency and explainability in AI operations, (3) framing as support tool rather than cost-cutting measure, and (4) demonstrated value in empowering rather than replacing staff. Implementation politics (how AI is positioned) matter more than technical features for adoption success.

**Chapter 5 Structure:**
- 5.X.1 Universal Replacement Fear (14/14 Participants)
- 5.X.2 Augmentation vs Replacement Framing
- 5.X.3 Leadership Messaging Criticality
- 5.X.4 Transparency as Trust Foundation
- 5.X.5 Cost-Cutting Framing Risk
- 5.X.6 Adoption Conditions for UGENTIC

---

## SECTION 6: CROSS-CUTTING PATTERNS (ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS)

### **6.1 VULNERABILITY SPECTRUM**
Not a primary theme but important sub-pattern:
- P13 (Intern): Most vulnerable - fear prevents learning
- P14 (Junior): Gatekeeping victim - set up to fail
- P11 (Night Shift): Abandoned - no specialist support
- P12 (Boundary Spanner): Punished for correct escalations

**Insight:** Vulnerability concentrates at specific roles/times. Ubuntu-AI must protect most vulnerable first.

### **6.2 FEAR AS PRIMARY BARRIER**
Coded across multiple participants but embedded in Theme 4:
- P13: "Biggest barrier isn't skill—it's fear"
- P14: "Assumes I'm lazy, not lost"
- P12: "Every dumb ticket feels like a threat"

**Insight:** Psychological barriers > technical barriers. AI must create safe learning environment.

### **6.3 DOMAIN SPECIFICITY UNIVERSAL**
All 14 participants mention casino operations context:
- 24/7 revenue-critical operations
- Gaming compliance requirements
- System-specific knowledge needs

**Insight:** Generic AI solutions fail. Domain customization non-negotiable for trust.
