0:02
And say yes or no, at least to get some to know there's someone there.

0:10
OK cool.

0:13
All right at least I'm not not alone here talking to myself all right OK cool.

0:20
So, so in terms of the structure, now you, I'm sure now you've completed your data collection, your data analysis, you're now putting together a dissertation, a report.

0:34
What I told you, remember in our discussions, I told you that the dissertation is not a proposal, right?

0:48
It's very important for you to to understand the distinction.

0:53
Just give me a moment.

0:54
I think I can't see my switch on my side.

0:57
Just give me a moment.

0:58
Sorry.

1:29
OK, cool.

1:30
It's better now.

1:31
I can see on my side.

1:33
So yes, so the proposal and dissertation, the different things, right?

1:40
So I know some students that you know, like what information from the proposal and moved it into the dissertation.

1:51
Just be careful about the language, right you.

1:55
For example, there are certain things in the proposed that you can't move to the dissertation, like your time frame, those timelines, the some of your, you know, like in the proposal you're saying, I'm going to do this, I'll be doing, you know, I'm going to do data collection.

2:22
I'll do you can't write like that in the dissertation, right?

2:26
Dissertation you have already completed your research, you're just reporting on your project, so the language should reflect that as well.

2:35
So by in the proposal, you're just proposing, you know, to do this and that, right.

2:42
So I've seen, I've been reading some documents and you know, everything they just picked from the proposal and just pasted everything, the dissertation, the language is just a mess, right?

2:55
So you need to go back and check, make sure your introduction, your background, your significance of study, all those different, the different sections and chapters, they all speak to the work that you have done, not the work that you intend to do, right?

3:20
Then make sure you, you have, so we have a standard, standard cover page, right with the logo, the Richford logo.

3:33
Then you have your your topic, your title of your dissertation, your research, and then then your name, your student number and then you say a dissertation.

3:49
A partial submission dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of the Bachelor of Science and as information technology postgraduate diploma in management and so on.

4:04
The reason we say partial fulfillment is because there are other things that you still need to fulfil, right You need to meet other requirements.

4:14
This is not the only requirement for you to to complete your your qualifications, right?

4:21
So in your dissertation, you must say a dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of.

4:28
Then you indicate your degree.

4:30
OK, then you put the name of the supervisor, you put the date that should be the cover page on all your dissertations.

4:41
Then from there, you go into your preliminary pages, your declaration, your acknowledgements, your abstract, your table of contents, and so on and so forth, right?

4:56
So once you're done with those preliminary pages, then you can go into your do your, do your actual, your, your main body, right?

5:06
I start with your chapters, Chapter 1, the introduction, chapter 2.

5:13
And so the introduction chapter one.

5:16
We shall we shall look into.

5:18
I think I'll, I'll just unpack each one.

5:21
But this is that's the structure.

5:22
Then you you make sure you you put an abstract, right.

5:31
It's just a summary of the abstract should have the introduction, right.

5:38
You briefly introduce the the research top candidate significance.

5:43
Then you clearly state the the some of the questions and objectives right.

5:49
But in a in a in a summary form, you don't for example, like say all the objectives are or maybe put sub headings, objectives or questions.

6:01
No, no, no, just in one, in that paragraph, in one block of text, you summarize your objectives, your methods, your results and conclusions, all those those are key components.

6:16
And for your abstract to be effective, to be properly written, it should have those elements, right.

6:24
You introduce the research topic, why it is significant, the some of the questions objective.

6:32
You can even pick like the most significant that you set out to achieve.

6:37
You summarize the research methodology that you use, you highlight the key findings, then you present the main conclusions and the implications of your research.

6:47
So as you can see, everything here is incorporated in this abstract that I talked about.

6:56
You know, so whoever will be reading your dissertation will get a full picture from the abstract just by reading the abstract and they will be able to pick up all these elements that I talked about.

7:10
OK, so let's go into chapters.

7:15
Your introduction chapter, that's chapter 1.

7:20
So chapter one will have the background.

7:23
So please make sure you have the background as the section should be the first section, right?

7:31
Where you, you set the stage for your dissertation, you provide essential information about the topic, right?

7:41
So this is like exactly what is happening with the historical context you, you provide the background knowledge, anything that will present a clear picture of the broader landscape that your, your study fits into.

8:01
You just put all that in the background, the status quo.

8:04
What is happening before you actually in introduce your topic or, or your solution to the problem.

8:13
What is the status quo?

8:14
That's what the background entails.

8:18
Your introduction.

8:20
That's the that's now when you introduce your topic, you provide the scope, the boundary boundaries and extent of your research, right?

8:34
So that's why you highlight the focus.

8:36
What's the focus?

8:38
What's my topic about?

8:41
OK, in light of the background, the, the, the, the context that you've provided in the background.

8:49
So there should be that link, that board and thread that should be there in, in, in all the sections actually.

9:00
And then after the introduction, you go into your aim and objective, please.

9:05
The aim is just only one statement.

9:07
The aim of this research is to do this, this and that.

9:10
That's it.

9:11
Do not explain the aim.

9:13
Do not put paragraphs and paragraphs and, and you know, I've seen some documents really, you know, and then then we have to say, please remove this, remove this, this is unnecessary.

9:32
So please, the aim was just just one line.

9:37
The aim of this research is to, you know, do this and this and that and that's.

9:44
Don't explain anything, right?

9:48
Then after that, you go into your objectives, right?

9:57
The objectives must be between 3:00 and 5:00.

9:59
That's the standard, right?

10:03
Don't have the objective shouldn't be less than three, and they shouldn't be more than 5.

10:11
And make sure that your objectives are rigorous, right?

10:17
There must be rigor in those objectives.

10:19
Don't just make them very, very simple and and you know with no depth, right, Give it some depth.

10:33
High level this high level objectives because because remember they are they are guiding your entire research.

10:43
Your entire research is aimed to achieve those specific objectives, right?

10:47
So that's why you must make sure that they, they are very broad, very rigorous, right?

10:55
And they encapsulate your end, what your entire research is about, right?

11:02
That's very important.

11:05
So once you you have your objectives, then you go to the questions.

11:10
Now, please, please, you need to note the order.

11:14
Do not start with questions and then objectives.

11:17
You must start with objectives.

11:20
After the objectives, do you have the questions?

11:22
That's that's the order, right?

11:26
The questions come from the objectives, right?

11:30
You have highlighted your specific objectives.

11:34
Then from those objectives come the questions.

11:38
So each objective must have corresponding question.

11:42
So there must be a direct alignment.

11:44
If you have 4 objectives, you must have 4 questions.

11:48
Each objective must have a corresponding question, right?

11:53
That's the coherence that we are talking about.

11:56
It's very important.

11:58
Those questions must be specific.

12:01
And these are not your operational questions from your questionnaire, you know, from data collection.

12:07
No, these are high level, broad questions that are very rigorous and they're they're specific, they're researchable, they guide your investigation, they provide a clear focus for your study.

12:27
So your your entire study is able to answer those specific questions.

12:32
So that's why they must be very broad, very regress really high level, not, not what is this?

12:39
What is that what you don't use, don't use the such terms, right?

12:45
They must be very regressed.

12:48
Then after that you go into your significance of study.

12:53
That part explains why your research is important.

12:57
The, the relevance of your study to differ, right?

13:03
What's its potential impact?

13:05
How does it contribute to existing knowledge?

13:09
So that's your chance to to shine, to really like make a case for your study and, and elevate it and justified the its significance.

13:20
It is, you know, it's very important because of this and this and that, right?

13:25
So you provide your your arguments there.

13:27
And remember, all your arguments must be steeped in literature.

13:31
So you must have citations and your citations must not be ordered in five years.

13:41
OK.

13:42
That's the same thing with the introduction with with, Yeah, with the introduction you don't put, please don't put citations in the objectives in the, in the in maybe aim you can, you can, but don't put citations the objectives don't put citations in the questions, only the significance of studied introduction.

14:06
And then you can put the other sections as well, right?

14:12
The hypothesis that's optional theoretical framework.

14:16
If you want, you can put those things and the structure of the dissertation, please, the structure of the dissertation is, is just one paragraph.

14:28
This you have already did.

14:31
Remember, this is at the end of chapter 1.

14:34
So someone who is reading, who is at that section, who's reading your, your dissertation?

14:44
And is that this that section of structure of the dissertation has already already almost covered chapter 1.

14:50
So you don't need even to put chapter one in the structure of the dissertation.

14:55
You just say Chapter 2 is literature review.

15:02
You know, it covers this and this and that.

15:04
Chapter 3 is, you know, research methodology.

15:07
Chapter 4 is the just to in one paragraph.

15:10
Don't don't have like 2 pages, 3 pages explaining this chapter by chapter.

15:17
No, no, no, right.

15:19
Already those chapters, you have that information in the chapters themselves, so you don't need to explain again in that section.

15:29
The chapters you just need to state in be concise and precise and just briefly, succinctly just state that Chapter 2 is is based on this.

15:42
Chapter 3 is about this.

15:44
Chapter 4 is about this just short sentences, just one paragraph.

15:49
That's the structure of the dissertation, right?

15:52
We provide that layout.

15:55
OK.

15:56
And then you go into your, your conclusion right now when you're doing your conclusion, I also want to highlight because from my experience, they're also like students make lots of errors here.

16:13
Do not introduce new knowledge, new, sorry, new information in that when you're concluding what you what you did not introduce in the in those sections, do not introduce it in the conclusion, right?

16:29
The conclusion you're only summarizing what you've already discussed in the other sections, right?

16:36
You reiterate the significance of your study.

16:39
You summarize the key points discussed such things, but do not introduce any new information that that you did not discuss in the other sections, right?

16:53
So chapter 2, Chapter 2 is your literature review.

16:58
OK, This one is very, very important.

17:01
Remember, it's everything.

17:05
Your entire dissertation revolves around this.

17:09
The issue review.

17:11
OK, Now you must use a thematic approach.

17:17
You identify major teams.

17:19
Sorry, you identify major teams.

17:25
These are like ideas or topics, right?

17:31
Motifs or motifs and, and then you, you discuss your literature around those specific motifs.

17:41
Right now it's not a summary.

17:44
Please do not, do not explain concepts.

17:49
No, do not summarize information.

17:54
This is a critical review.

17:56
It's a critical analysis, right?

18:00
So you, you, you bring different ideas together and you identify gaps.

18:08
For example, author A indicated that you know that this idea is is supposed to be like this, but author B proposed that no, it, it should be like this.

18:20
Then author C posted this and that.

18:25
So however, I think considering author AB and C, there's still a gap here because none discussed this, this, this and see, so you're doing an it's an analytical review, right?

18:43
You, you critique the existing ideas, the existing literature and you identify gaps, right?

18:55
But you all this must be structured around the motifs, the themes that you have identified in connection to your topic, right?

19:05
Don't.

19:06
So it's very important.

19:08
And when you put these themes, please don't mention that theme.

19:11
Don't I've seen also some mistakes.

19:15
Just say theme one, then you put your theme, theme two.

19:19
No, no, don't mention the don't say theme.

19:22
Just put the actual theme.

19:24
You don't need to mention theme, the word theme, OK, It's very important.

19:30
You can always, you can have like a brief introduction just to introduce your chapter.

19:36
Just provide an overview of the chapter and you set the stage right.

19:40
And then after that, you go into your key studies, you discuss those findings and gaps and you mention each you should have those headings, those each, each theme section should begin with a clear heading that describes the theme.

19:58
OK, yeah.

20:02
Then you can examine different perspectives, you can highlight methodologies, you can express trends, patterns, identify what are the controversies and all these things.

20:13
So.

20:14
That's how you synthesize your information here.

20:19
And, and as you, as you critique what other people have done and as you do that, don't lose sight of your, of your, your idea.

20:29
All right.

20:32
Remember you're building a case for your idea.

20:34
So the even the gaps that you identified there should be a connection to your to your idea to the problem, right?

20:42
They formally a very strong premise for your program.

20:47
OK.

20:47
So when it comes to program statement, then you can connect to the gaps that you've identified in the literary view and then from a very, very solid basis for your for your program.

21:02
And that's why the program statement comes immediately after the literature review.

21:07
So, so here you can also start with your introduction and then you're going to the program maybe just before that, please on the literature, if you please, make sure you have as many citations as possible, please.

21:23
I've I've received messages or actions are asking me or how many pages should I have?

21:29
Sorry, how many citations and references should I?

21:34
There's no number of citation, no number of references, right, Because these chapters are different.

21:42
You, the references for Chapter 1, they're not, they're not the same as references for Chapter 2 literature review.

21:52
Obviously you have so many citations, right?

21:57
Because that's what it's about.

21:58
It's about literature.

22:01
So, so you can't say, oh, for each chapter you should have this, this number of set of references of citations.

22:10
No, it doesn't work like that.

22:13
You must make sure that you have a sufficient number based on the way you're writing.

22:19
Usually I told you that even in the introduction, right?

22:27
For every like line, you must have a citation.

22:31
You, you can't write, for example, more than two lines without a citation.

22:37
So the more citations, the better.

22:39
Then when it comes, if you definitely here, it's, you know, you must have many citations here, right?

22:48
Same thing with the problem.

22:51
Once you you, you, you provide an overview, then you go into the problem.

22:57
What's the call of the program statement?

22:59
You'd find a specific issue or the challenge that your research is addressing.

23:06
Here you describe the problem in detail.

23:09
Explain what makes it a problem.

23:16
Who does it affect?

23:18
Why?

23:18
Why?

23:19
Why is it that it has not been resolved?

23:22
Now that's why you read Shareview comes in OK, you link that your to the gaps you identified and the problems that you picked up in the in your in your critical review, OK.

23:37
So in other words, you should make a comparing case for why this program needs to be investigated, why it was needed to be investigated, right?

23:49
And then how it contributes to solving or understanding this problem better.

23:55
Yeah, like your research.

23:58
So then you you really have to describe your program in detail, what was the problem, why you set out solve this problem.

24:07
And then you can just find that with the literature review.

24:11
And then after that you can't, you also provide the conclusion, hey now, maybe just to make a point, Chapter 3, I've seen some students also combine this with Chapter 1, which is fine.

24:36
If you do a, you just need to see how you can combine them.

24:43
That's fine.

24:45
That structure is also acceptable, right?

24:47
You just have to make sure you've you've discussed it thoroughly in your chapter 1.

24:54
OK, that's fine if you want to do it that way, but the best structure is this where you have a you use separate your program, put on, give it a chapter on its own, and then you provide detailed discussion and you link it to your literature review, right?

25:17
Then after that you go into your methodology, same thing you start, you give it some background, some context, and the foundation for your methodology chapter, you explain the overarching research design.

25:31
OK, how does it fit within the broader scope of your study?

25:35
That's what you, you just provide some context and then you go into the research design, which is which is the which is the, the overall strategy that you have employed in your research.

25:53
Did you use quantitative?

25:54
Did you use quantitative?

25:55
Did you use mixed methods?

25:57
You know, so you, those are different the frameworks, what framework underpinned your research design?

26:07
And then you go into reliability and validity, how you ensured reliability and validity of your research, the measures that you took to ensure that your data collection and analysis are consistent and accurate.

26:24
OK.

26:25
And then your target preparation, your preparation sample data collection instruments, you explain all this.

26:33
Remember, as you explain, you're using your sighting and do not explain like a, like a proposal, right?

26:46
Because in your proposal say like you know, you explain them like you haven't used them, you haven't deployed them, right?

26:58
But remember, you have already used these tools, these instruments, you know the proportion sample you've this is a report.

27:07
So even the way you're writing, make sure it to reflect that, right?

27:12
Make sure it captures that.

27:15
So your data analysis, your ethical considerations, your limitations, and the summary as well.

27:22
OK, all right, then we come to the most important chapter, which is the results.

27:29
Because without results, you know your research is incomplete, right?

27:37
So here you must spend a lot of time on your results.

27:41
You must, your results should really give you satisfaction.

27:46
You should see that you have produced good results because you've you've collected data, you've collected data, you've analyzed your data, you've done a lot of work.

27:59
Now this is the outcome of your research.

28:03
So you, you're proud of what you have done And so this, so you put in a lot here, right?

28:10
You present your results, you can first give an overview, you explain the context of your research results and the purpose of presenting them.

28:20
And then after that you go into your, the response rate, for example, the data collection process, how well, how it was, how many participants were involved, the methods that you used, some of any relevant feedback received.

28:39
You can just tease out like highlights.

28:43
You don't have to to put everything here, but you can tease out just a few things that stood out, right?

28:54
So then in then you, you, you provide your results.

29:00
Please, you must have at least three graphs.

29:05
Don't have like just only tables or just one graph.

29:11
Or you know, so you must have at least.

29:14
The more graphs the better, right?

29:17
You can't have only tables, you must have graphs.

29:22
If you want to have tables.

29:23
You can have tables as well, but you must have graphs just to provide that visual representation of your results.

29:32
And then you interpret those graphs in very well in detail.

29:36
All right, this line is like this.

29:38
Because of this and that you link them to objectives, you link them to questions, you ensure there's a logical flow coherence, there are no incongruities.

29:48
And that gives you your work credibility and gravitas.

29:53
So here you, the results chapter is very, very, it's crucial.

29:58
It's what will make you pass or fail your dissertation.

30:03
OK, for the most part.

30:06
So you need to do a proper interpretation of your results, linking them to your objectives.

30:13
What are the the patterns in your result that you that you are able to observe?

30:21
All right, what do you want to hire?

30:27
What are the trends?

30:28
What are those significant results that you want to highlight that were very prominent or significant in your in your in your data analysis?

30:42
You know, so all that comes here.

30:48
Then after that, you give your conclusion presentation of your results and and summarize the main findings.

30:57
OK, the main findings, right.

31:05
But the the interpretation, the interpretation is very important.

31:11
You can't, for example, you can't just put graphs, they or tables they and say these, you know, results and this, this means this and that.

31:23
No, no, no, you have to do a, a detailed interpretation.

31:27
What, what does this mean?

31:29
Why is those, what are those numbers?

31:31
What do they mean?

31:33
Why is it A5?

31:34
Why is it a six?

31:36
What's on the X axis?

31:38
What's on the Y axis?

31:39
What does it mean?

31:40
You know, so you do like a detailed interpretation of your results, right?

31:47
After that, you go into the last chapter, which is your conclusion.

31:52
This is like a recap of your entire dissertation.

31:56
It includes the high level overview of your research program, your methodology, your key findings, and your overall contributions, right?

32:07
So in other words, you're reminding the reader of the journey that you have, the journey that you have worked, that you've taken from the beginning to the end.

32:23
You highlight those core aspects of your study, right?

32:27
Please, it's very important that you be concise and focus on the main points, right?

32:34
Again, do not introduce new things here, right?

32:42
Do not, do not introduce like new things, new discoveries, new insights that you never introduced before, right?

32:53
Just be careful, right?

32:56
So you must highlight the key results you the what were the principal outcomes that emerge from your data analysis?

33:05
You discussed the major discoveries that your study has brought to light.

33:11
So, but you do that like in a, in a concise manner, OK, you just don't, don't go into lots of stories, right?

33:23
But what, maybe what's important here is really your contributions, because you're proud of your contributions.

33:30
You've done a lot of work, you put in so much and you have your results.

33:36
You've, you feel that you've contribute, you've your research is significant, OK, you've made a contribution to the body of knowledge.

33:48
So it, this is a chance for you to highlight some of those insights, the novel insights that your research carries, that your, that your research contains.

33:59
And, and even someone who is reading this chapter, the end of it all, definitely it will give them assurance and confidence even when they're upgrading your work and, and will give you work credibility and respect.

34:16
OK, so please take time to to, to write your conclusion very well, OK, and make sure you, you don't miss anything important and you connect everything to what you already discussed in the other chapters.

34:31
All right, reference, you know, Harvard, please, please make sure that you're referencing is, is is is correct.

34:41
So I can't, there are no like I can't tell you that, Oh, if you, if you, if you, you have incorrect references, they are going to take off these marks or something.

34:53
No, no, no, it doesn't work like that.

34:56
So it's just, it's just biases the, the, the, the, the examiner.

35:08
Remember these, your dissertations will be externally examined.

35:12
We don't examine dissertations.

35:16
We send them to the external experts.

35:19
These are professors, these are experts in their foods based on your topic, right?

35:31
So, so there's nothing that you're going to produce that will, you know that they won't pick up if there's any mistake, they will definitely pick that up, right?

35:44
I've been doing this for years.

35:46
I know, right?

35:48
Students have failed, students have passed.

35:51
And so you have to be careful and listen to what I'm telling you.

35:59
Just take your time, do this well and just follow my instructions and you'll be OK.

36:07
But the, the examination process is very, these people are very pedantic and and you have to be careful, have to be very careful.

36:19
All right.

36:22
So please make sure that there's proper referencing using your Harvard style, your citations.

36:28
Make sure that your references are not ordered in five years.

36:31
In fact, they should be within like the range or something like that.

36:35
Otherwise when you have these old ones, they all they'll say your work is outdated and like you if for example, if they see like 2 dated references at the beginning, you know it's just they've come.

36:57
I mean, it, it changes the entire perspective around about your work, right?

37:05
And you don't want that, right?

37:08
You must put the best, your best foot forward always and, and make sure whatever you're producing, it's really, it's a, it's a, it's a good piece of work.

37:21
OK, So check, make sure your hologram fencing star in their penises.

37:29
Please don't put, don't, don't insert raw data, for example, in the body of your document, right?

37:39
Your raw data, for example, like your your questionnaire questions, you know some of those things, they come in their penises.

37:50
Don't put them in the in the other chapters, right?

37:56
Please don't put them in the other chapters, your code.

38:03
And also when you're putting in the apprentices, just put like samples.

38:07
You shouldn't put like more than one page, right?

38:11
If you want to show like a snippet of code, just put like half a page.

38:18
Your ethical clearance.

38:21
You can just put because that's just one page.

38:23
You can just put it there.

38:25
Your question and survey.

38:26
You can just put like half a page of just just a sample questions, you know, So because some people tend to oh, because I, I need to raise 80 pages, so I just put like all like 10 pages of code.

38:45
You know, that's unacceptable, right?

38:49
Because their pencils pages are not even counted.

38:53
So just only put samples like half a page, just one page and that's it.

39:00
That's just for for for you, for your information.

39:04
Like you're telling the examiner, this is just for your information, right?

39:09
They don't even cost status these things, but just for your information, right?

39:17
You can just put that.

39:18
So don't put a lot of things they OK, as you know, in terms of the requirements, minimum number of pages 80 and then the maximum number is 120.

39:29
Don't go beyond 120 pages and don't submit less than 80 pages, please.

39:38
Right.

39:41
Then the other one is to wait, I think, sorry.

39:45
The other one is the external proofreading.

39:48
So this one also, we've like I told you, we're partnered with an external to do external proof reading before you submit for grading, just to check to make sure that there's no way for you to fail.

40:06
Just just to give you some you need some peace.

40:13
Otherwise people will get stressed out.

40:15
But but this gives you some assurance because they check that based on the.

40:20
On the on the rubric and the structure that that will be used for grading the dissertation and check each chapter, each section, everything write properly do everything the formatting and then after that they give you a certificate and you attach that certificate to your submission proving that your dissertation has been proof read by the profession.

40:44
That's very important.

40:45
You attach that and then the examiner will see that as well, right.

40:52
So that is an external survey.

40:57
It's not compulsory.

40:58
It's not, no one's imposing anything on you.

41:02
It's not compulsory, but it's important.

41:05
If you need that, you just need to reuse with me privately and then I'll link you up to talk, talk to to the consultant.

41:15
And because they because of our partnership, there's a subsidized cost only for Richford students only.

41:26
There are students from other institutions.

41:27
They pay a fortune for these things, but there's a very subsidy, just a small, small, small cost.

41:35
All right.
